The code should return the count of all duplicate, case-insensitive, 
alphanumeric characters, that occur more than once in the given string. 
Characters should also be presented in the order in which they appear 
in the string. For instance, 'abba' should output 'a' as the firstcharacter 
that has a duplicate.
