Some tests for your program are:

| Description | Input | Output |
| :---------- | :---- | :----- |
| No Input                    |      | "Usage: ./fractions operand1 operator operand2" |
| Empty Input                 | ""   | "Usage: ./fractions operand1 operator operand2" |
| Sample Input: | 2/3 + 4/5 | 22/15 |
| Sample Input: | 2/3 * 4/5  | 8/15 |
| Sample Input: | 2/3 - 4/5  | -2/15 |
| Sample Input: | 2/3 / 4/5  | 5/6 |
| Sample Input: | 2/3 == 4/5 | 0 |
| Sample Input: | 2/3 > 4/5 | 0 |
| Sample Input: | 2/3 < 4/5 | 1 |
| Sample Input: | 2/3 >= 4/5 | 0 |
| Sample Input: | 2/3 <= 4/5 | 1 |
| Sample Input: | 2/3 != 4/5 | 1 |
