In general, a fractions library should perform the following:

1. Perform arithmatic operation like multiplications, addition etc.
2. Give output for relational operations like >=, >, == etc.

More specifically, begin with creating object instance of fraction class with two attributes:
numerator and denomenator.Using operator overloading feature of langauge implement basic arithmatic
and relational operaions.

For instance `./fractions "6/2" "+" "1/4"` would output `13/4`

In addition, there should be some error handling for situations where the user
doesn't supply any input.
