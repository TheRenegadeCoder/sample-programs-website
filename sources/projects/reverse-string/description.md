While Hello World is simple, it often does not show off many interesting
features of a language. Fortunately, this repository shares more samples than
Hello World. One of these more complex programs is known as Reverse a String.

In this repository, the algorithm must reverse ASCII strings. Do **NOT**
worry about reversing a string in the general case. For instance, if a string
contains surrogate pairs, it's okay if the solution corrupts the string during reversal.
