Despite the explicit name, there are some rules in place for consistency.
When writing a Reverse a String program, the following rules should apply:

1. The implementation must be executable
2. The string to be reversed must come from the command line
3. The program must verify the strings existence on the command line
4. The user must not import libraries to obfuscate the string manipulation

In other words, the program should get a string from the command line and
reverse it using language utilities only. Acceptable language utilities include
language features and built-in libraries.

External dependencies are unacceptable. Remember, the goal is to show off language
features and utilities.
