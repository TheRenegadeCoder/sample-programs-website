Given a list, L, of integers, we can compute the weighted sum, W, as followed:

```
W = L[0] * 0 + L[1] * 1 + ... + L[N - 1] * N - 1
```

In this case, N is the length of the list. As a result, if the list contained 5 items,
the last term in the list would be multiplied by 4.

Given that we can compute the weighted sum, the purpose of this project is to
find the maximum array rotation. In other words, if we were to rotate the list N 
times (note: rotation direction does not matter), what's the largest weighted sum 
we could get? Here's what that would look like with this list (2, 8, 3, 1):

1. `(2, 8, 3, 1) = (2 * 0) + (8 * 1) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 3) = 0 + 8 + 6 + 3 = 17`
2. `(1, 2, 8, 3) = (1 * 0) + (2 * 1) + (8 * 2) + (3 * 3) = 0 + 2 + 16 + 9 = 27`
3. `(3, 1, 2, 8) = (3 * 0) + (1 * 1) + (2 * 2) + (8 * 3) = 0 + 1 + 4 + 24 = 29`
4. `(8, 3, 1, 2) = (8 * 0) + (3 * 1) + (1 * 2) + (2 * 3) = 0 + 3 + 2 + 6 = 11`

Ultimately, we want to find the largest sum. That appears to happen during our
second rotation (i.e. line 3) where we get a weighted sum of 29.
