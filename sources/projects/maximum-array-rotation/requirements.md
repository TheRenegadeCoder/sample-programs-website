A Maximum Array Rotation program should function as follows:

```shell
$ ./maximum-array-rotation.lang "8, 3, 1, 2"
$ 29
```

In other words, the user should call the program on the command line with a string
of comma separeted integers. If done properly, the program should output the 
Maximum Array Rotation. See the following testing section for more specific requirements.
