Merge sort is an algorithm that works by dividing a list into smaller lists.
It continues dividing until each list only has a single element in it
because lists of a single element are by definition already sorted.
It then merges each sublist in a sorted fashion until they all become a single sorted list.

Step by step the process is:

1. Divide the sorted list into lists of 1 element.
2. Continually merge the lists together until they become a single list. Do the merge as follows:
    * Compare the smallest items in each of the two lists to be merged.
    * Move the smaller of the two to the new merged list
    * Repeat until there are no unmerged items


### Performance

The performance of sorting algorithms is generally defined in "Big O notation".
If you are not familiar with such notations, please refer to the relevant
article by Rob Bell or the wikipedia entry listed in further readings below.

| | |
|---|---|
| Best case | O(n log n) |
| Average case | O(n log n) |
| Worst case | O(n log n) |
