For the purposes of this repository, the following rules apply:

> Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 100. However, for multiples of three,
> print "Fizz" instead of the number. Meanwhile, for multiples of five, print "Buzz"
> instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five,
> print "FizzBuzz"

To be even more specific, please output each value on its own line. The output
should look something like:

```console
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```

The program should then be saved in a file called fizz buzz using the proper
naming conventions of your choice language.
