Suppose you have a set of points in the plane. The **convex hull** of this set is the smallest
convex polygon that contains all the points.

A good way to visualize the problem is this: Imagine each point is a nail sticking out of the plane,
and you stretch a rubber band around them and let it go. The band will contract and assume a shape
that encloses the nails. This shape is the convex hull.

Note that all vertices of the convex hull are points in the original set. So the convex hull is really
a subset of points from the original set, and there may be points that lie inside the polygon but are
not vertices of the convex hull.
