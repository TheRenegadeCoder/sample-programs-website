Depth first search is a type of graph search algorithm. It is often used on trees 
(which are special types of graphs).
It takes linear time to traverse a graph and find a given vertex, specifically O(num_vertices + num_edges).
This search algorithm is often used by web crawlers or in machine learning tasks.
There, the graph that should be traversed is often too big to be do it in a single run.
In such cases, the algorithm can be limited in different ways, for example by limiting depth or visited nodes.

The algorithm traverses the graph one node after the other, but takes priority in going deeper into 
the graph opposed to going broader first. This means, that it visits further children of children before visiting
potential siblings of them.
