Welcome to the Transpose Matrix page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; 
that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix A by producing another matrix, often 
denoted by A<sup>T</sup>. For example, the following matrix could be the matrix A:

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| - |:-:| -:|
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |

Once transposed, A becomes the following matrix, A<sup>T</sup>:

| 1 | 4 | 7 |
| - |:-:| -:|
| 2 | 5 | 8 |
| 3 | 6 | 9 |

The transpose of a matrix was introduced in 1858 by the British mathematician Arthur Cayley.


## Requirements

For the purposes of this project, we'll ask that you create a program which accepts
a matrix as a list of integers and the dimensions of that matrix in the following
format:

```
transpose-matrix.lang 3 3 "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"
```

Here, the first two input numbers indicate the column and row size of the matrix, respectively, and the 
next input is the list of numbers to be included in the matrix.


## Testing

Verify that the actual output matches the expected output (see [requirements][1])
