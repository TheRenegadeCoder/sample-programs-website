For the purposes of this project, we'll ask that you create a program which accepts
a matrix as a list of integers and the dimensions of that matrix in the following
format:

```
transpose-matrix.lang 3 3 "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"
```

Here, the first two input numbers indicate the column and row size of the matrix, respectively, and the 
next input is the list of numbers to be included in the matrix.
