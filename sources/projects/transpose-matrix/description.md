In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; 
that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix A by producing another matrix, often 
denoted by A<sup>T</sup>. For example, the following matrix could be the matrix A:

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| - |:-:| -:|
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |

Once transposed, A becomes the following matrix, A<sup>T</sup>:

| 1 | 4 | 7 |
| - |:-:| -:|
| 2 | 5 | 8 |
| 3 | 6 | 9 |

The transpose of a matrix was introduced in 1858 by the British mathematician Arthur Cayley.
