For the purposes of this repo, the solution should be simple. We're not here
to play code golf, but we're also not here to practice obfuscation. Just be
reasonable with your solution. Finally, the solution must **not** read its own
source code file. For example, this is **not** a permissible solution:

```python
with open("quine.py") as f:
    print(f.read())
```
