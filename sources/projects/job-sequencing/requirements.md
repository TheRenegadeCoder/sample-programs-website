In order to implement this program in your choice language, you should
define the input interface as follows:

```console
$ ./job-sequencing.lang "25, 15, 10, 5" "3, 1, 2, 2"
```

In other words, the input routine should accept a list of profits and
a list of deadlines. It will be up to the program to verify that these
lists are valid.

Once the program has determined a correct sequence, it should
output the maximum profit only. For example:

```console
$ ./job-sequencing.lang "25, 15, 10, 5" "3, 1, 2, 2"
$ 50
```

Naturally, this is for testing
purposes as verifying all of the possible sequences would be
challenging.
