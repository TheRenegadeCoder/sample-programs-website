ROT-13 is a letter substitution cipher where every letter is replaced by the
letter 13 letters after it alphabetically and wrapping from `Z` to `A` if necessary:

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ -> NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM

As a result, encrypted strings can be decrypted using the same algorithm:

    NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM -> ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
