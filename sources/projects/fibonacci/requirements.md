For this sample program, each solution should leverage dynamic programming to produce this
list up to the nth term. For instance, `./fib 5` on the command line should output

```
1: 1
2: 1
3: 2
4: 3
5: 5
```

In addition, there should be some error handling for situations where the user
doesn't supply any input or the user supplies input that is not a number
(i.e. `./fib` or `./fib hello`, respectively).
