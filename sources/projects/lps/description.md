Palindrome is a phenomenon, where a string has same sequence of letters when read start --> end and end --> start.

Let's say we have a string,

```
s = 'paapaapap'
```

Here, we have seven palindromic substrings. 

```
sub_1 = 'aa'
sub_2 = 'paap'
sub_3 = 'paapaap'
sub_4 = 'aapaa'
sub_5 = 'apap'
sub_6 = 'pap'
sub_7 = 'apaapa'
```

Out of the seven,  `sub_3 = 'paapaap'` is the longest. hence the output would be `'paapaap'`
