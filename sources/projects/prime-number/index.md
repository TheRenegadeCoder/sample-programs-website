Welcome to the Prime Number page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

A prime number is a positive integer which is divisible only by 1 and itself.
For example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13

Since every number is divisible by One so, Two is the only even and the
smallest prime number.


## Requirements

Create a file called Prime Number using the naming
convention appropriate for your language of choice.

Write a sample program which accepts an integer on the command line
and outputs if the integer is a Prime number or not.


## Testing

The following table contains various test cases that you can use to verify the 
correctness of your solution:

| Description | Input | Output |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| No Input | | "Usage: please input a non-negative integer" |
| Empty Input | "" | "Usage: please input a non-negative integer" |
| Invalid Input: not a number | a | "Usage: please input a non-negative integer" |
| Invalid Input: not an integer | 6.7 | "Usage: please input a non-negative integer" |
| Invalid Input: negative | -7  | "Usage: please input a non-negative integer" |
| Sample Input: Zero | 0 | Composite |
| Sample Input: One | 1 | Composite |
| Sample Input: Two | 2 | Prime |
| Sample Input: Small Composite | 4 | Composite |
| Sample Input: Small Prime | 7 | Prime |
| Sample Input: Large Composite | 4011 | Composite |
| Sample Input: Large Prime | 3727 | Prime |
