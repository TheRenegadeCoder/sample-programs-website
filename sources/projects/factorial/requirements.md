You must write an executable program that accepts an integer `n` on standard
input via the command line, and outputs `n!` to standard output.

Note that the factorial function grows very quickly. For example, `4! = 24`
but `8! = 40320`. Therefore, you should impose a limit on the input, so that
the largest factorial still fits into your language's largest supported datatype.

Also note that the factorial is not defined for negative integers.
