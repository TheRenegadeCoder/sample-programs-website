Create a file called Roman Numeral Conversion using whatever naming
convention is appropriate for the choice language.

Using the table above, write a sample program which accepts a Roman numeral on
the command line and outputs its decimal value on standard output. Be careful
to appropriately handle invalid input such as `XT`. More on that in the testing
section.

_Please_ make sure your program is executable. In other words, the solution
should be able to be called in the appropriate environment with a string
of roman numerals (i.e. `./roman-numeral-conversion XXVI`).
