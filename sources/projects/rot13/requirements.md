Write a sample program that takes a string of text as input.
It should then encrypt the inputted text using ROT13 and output the result to the console.

```console
$ ./rot13.lang "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcrq bire gur ynml qbt
```

The solution should handle both lower case and capital letters

```console
$ ./rot13.lang "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG"
GUR DHVPX OEBJA SBK WHZCRQ BIRE GUR YNML QBT
```

Any characters/symbols besides a-z and A-Z should be ignored.

```console
$ ./rot13.lang "The quick brown fox jumped. Was it over the lazy dog?"
Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcrq. Jnf vg bire gur ynml qbt?
```

In addition, there should be some error handling for situations where the user
doesn't supply any input.
