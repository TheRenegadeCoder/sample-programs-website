To satisfy the requirements, a program must accept a string on the command line and return a new string
with all spaces removed as follows:

```shell
$ remove-all-whitespace.lang "   Hello, World!   "
$ "Hello,World!"
```

In this case, we start with a string that has leading, trailing, and inner spaces. Ultimately, we want to
return a string with all of the spaces removed.
