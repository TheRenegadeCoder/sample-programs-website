A string is a collection of characters. Sometimes strings contain whitespace characters like " ", "\t", and "\n". 
The purpose of this project is to remove all such spaces from a string. For example, given the string 
"Remove All Whitespace", we could generate a new string with all the whitespace removed as follows: 
"RemoveAllWhitespace". In this case, two spaces were removed at positions 6 and 10.   

For simplicity, we will be restricting the types of whitespace to these four types of characters: spaces (" "),
tabs ("\t"), newlines ("\n"), and carriage returns ("\r"). We are aware that other types of whitespace exist.
That said, programs in this collection tend to be simple, so we can replicate them in as many programming
languages as possible.
