You must write an executable program that accepts a string of comma separated integers on `standard input` via the sys args, and outputs the maximum subarray sum value to `standard output`.

Note that the Kadane's algorithm assumes that there is atleast 1 negative integer in the array.
If there is no negative integer, then the max subarray sum value is the sum of all the elements of the array.

Also note that if the input string is empty, then the output is "Usage: Please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format: '1, 2, 3, 4, 5'".
