Most languages have built-in utilities or functions for reading and writing files.
Many of these input/output functions follow a similar pattern across programming languages:
a string to the path of the file and a "mode". A mode is how the files is opened.
Will the file be opened for reading, writing, or even both?
Will the file be appending new content? Truncated?
