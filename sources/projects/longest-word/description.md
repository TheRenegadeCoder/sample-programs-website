Given a string, this program should break it up into words and determine
the length of the longest word. In this case, a word is defined as anything
surrounded by whitespace. For simplicity, we'll restrict whitespace to the
following four special characters:

- Spaces: " "
- Tabs: "\t"
- Newlines: "\n"
- Carriage Returns: "\r"

For example, if we had a string, "How now brown cow", we can figure out which
word is the longest by breaking up the string into words. In this case, this
string has the following four words:

- "How"
- "now"
- "brown"
- "cow"

In this case, "brown" is clearly the longest word, so we'll return 5 as a result.
