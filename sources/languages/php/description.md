According to [Wikipedia][1] PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source server-side scripting language designed for web development. It was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 and has since become one of the most popular languages for building dynamic web applications and websites.

- Server-Side Scripting: PHP is primarily used on web servers to process code and generate dynamic web content. It runs on the server and sends the resulting HTML to the client's web browser.

- Database Integration: PHP has built-in support for a wide range of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and others. This enables developers to create web applications that can store and retrieve data from databases.

- Open Source: PHP is open-source software, which means it's freely available, and developers can contribute to its development and improvement.

PHP is commonly used to build dynamic websites, content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, e-commerce platforms, web applications, and web services. It can be embedded within HTML files or used in combination with other technologies like JavaScript, CSS, and databases to create interactive and feature-rich web experiences.
