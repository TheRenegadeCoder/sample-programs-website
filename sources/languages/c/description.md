As usual, I decided to dive into the history of C with [Wikipedia][1].

According to Wikipedia, C is a general-purpose programming language that 
was developed as early as 1969 at Bell Labs by Dennis Richie. Today, the 
C language has influenced the design of many languages such as C++, C#, 
Go, Java, and many, many more.

Features of C include static typing, lexical variable scope, and recursion. 
In addition, function parameters are passed by value, not reference, but 
pass-by-reference can be accomplished by explicitly using pointers. Also, 
while C has static typing, variables are weakly typed and can be converted implicitly.
