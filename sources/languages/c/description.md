[C][1] is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as early 
as 1969 at Bell Labs by Dennis Richie. Today, the C language has influenced 
the design of many languages such as C++, C#, Go, Java, and many, many more.

Features of C include static typing, lexical variable scope, and recursion. 
In addition, function parameters are passed by value, not reference, but 
pass-by-reference can be accomplished by explicitly using pointers. Also, 
while C has static typing, variables are weakly typed and can be converted 
implicitly.
