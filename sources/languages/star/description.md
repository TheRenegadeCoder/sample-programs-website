According to [Wikipedia][1], C* is a language that was originally designed as an
alternative to \*Lisp and CM-FORTRAN. Beyond that, thereâ€™s really not much
documentation.

That said, I did manage to dig up [the user guide for C*][2] if you want to play
around with that. If you have any additional documentation, let me know.
