To run the fractions operation in cpp program, grab a copy of the fractions.cpp file
from GitHub. After that, get the latest version of g++ compiler. Now, all you have to
do is run the following from the command line:

```console
g++ fractions.cpp -o fractions
./fractions "1/4" "+" "5/8"
```

Alternatively, you can always copy the source code into an online c++
compiler. Just make sure you pass some input to your program before you run
it.
