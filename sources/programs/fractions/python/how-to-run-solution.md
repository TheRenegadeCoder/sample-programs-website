To run the fractions operation in python program, grab a copy of the fractions.py file
from GitHub. After that, get the latest version of python interpreter. Now, all you have to
do is run the following from the command line:

```console
python fraction.py "1/4" "+" "5/8"
```

Alternatively, you can always copy the source code into an online python interpreter. Just make sure you pass some input to your program before you run it.
