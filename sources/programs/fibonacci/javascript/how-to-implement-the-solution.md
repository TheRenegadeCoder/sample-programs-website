Let's look at the code in detail:  

code for fibonacci.js:-  

```javascript
function fibonacci(num) {
    let n = Number(num);
    let first = 0;
    let second = 1;
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        result = first + second;
        first = second;
        second = result;
        console.log(i + ": " + first);
    }
}

num = process.argv[2];

if (num && !isNaN(num)) {
    fibonacci(num);
} else {
    console.log("Usage: please input the count of fibonacci numbers to output")
}

```

Here we have a function called "fibonacci" that takes in a numeric value as an argument that corresponds to the amount fibonacci numbers we want to print in succession.

What "fibonacci" does is that it starts printing from 1 then each time it just prints the accumulation of the last number it printed (stored in variable named "second") and the 2nd last number it printed (stored in variable named "first").

Then we have a variable named "num" which can have a numeric value of "10" since we want to print the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. I can also have the value "process.argv[2]" so we can run the command "node fibonacci.js 10" to execute the file with NodeJS and print the first 10 numbers in the fibonacci sequence.

Then we have a function that verifies that "num" has a positive, numeric value so we can run the function named "fibonacci", else it just returns an instruction/warning.
