One can run the code on C++ IDE's like [CodeBlocks][1], [Turboc++][2], [Eclipse for C/C++][3], etc.
Their installation is guided by the setup wizards and once install can allow you to 
run the locally on your machine, all these IDE's are available free of cost on their
respective websites.

Perhaps the easiest way to run the solution is to leverage the online gdb 
compiler.

Alternatively, you can try to run the C++ code in a similar way described in the last article. Honestly, it's pretty easy to write and run C/C++ code 
on most platforms:

```console
gcc -o insertion-sort reverse-string.cpp
```

Unfortunately, Windows pretty much requires the use of [Visual Studio][4]. So, 
instead of sharing platform-specific directions, I'll fall back on my
[online compiler recommendation][5].
