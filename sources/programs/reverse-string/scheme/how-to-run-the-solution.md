The quickest way is probably to try use an online Scheme interpreter. Just copy
the code above, drop it into the editor, fill in some input and hit run.

As an alternative, you can download CHICKEN Scheme and a copy of the solution
file from Github. Assuming CHICKEN Scheme is on your path, you can run the
script from a command line with the following command:

```console
csi -s reverse-string.scm
```

This will run the Scheme file which will print out whatever you enter on the
command line.
