The quickest way is probably to try use an [online Scheme interpreter][1]. Just copy
the code above, drop it into the editor, fill in some input and hit run.

As an alternative, you can download [CHICKEN Scheme][2] and a copy of the solution
file from Github. Assuming CHICKEN Scheme is on your path, you can run the
script from a command line with the following command:

```console
csi -s reverse-string.scm
```

This will run the Scheme file which will print out whatever you enter on the
command line.
