The most common way for programmers to run Swift code is via Apple’s XCode IDE.
It’s free and available on the Mac App Store. You can paste this code snippet
directly into an XCode file and run it.

You should use an online Swift compiler if your machine can’t handle XCode, or
you just don’t want to download it (it’s quite big). This web compiler is
up-to-date with Swift 4. Note that Swift updates yearly, so many web compilers
are out of date and unable to run this code.
