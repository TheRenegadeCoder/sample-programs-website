The most common way for programmers to run Swift code is via [Apple's XCode IDE][4].
It's free and available on the Mac App Store. You can paste this [code snippet][5]
directly into an XCode file and run it.

You should use an [online Swift compiler][6] if your machine can't handle XCode, or
you just don't want to download it (it's quite big). This web compiler is
up-to-date with Swift 5 (at the time of this writing). Note that Swift updates yearly,
so many web compilers are out of date and unable to run this code.
