With our solution implemented, we should probably give it a run. Perhaps the easiest
way to run the solution is to [copy it][1] into an [online VB.NET compiler][2].

Alternatively, we can run the solution using Microsoft's very own [Visual Studio][3].
Of course, I'm not sure of it's support on platforms beyond Windows. Don't forget
to grab a copy of the [Reverse String in Visual Basic .NET][1] solution.
