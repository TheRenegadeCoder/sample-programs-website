To run the Reverse a String in Python program, grab a copy of the [Python file from GitHub][1].
After that, get the [latest version of Python][2]. Now, all you have to
do is run the following from the command line:

```console
python reverse-string.py "Hello, World!"
```

Alternatively, you can always copy the source code into an [online Python interpreter][3].
Just make sure you pass some input to your script before you run it.
