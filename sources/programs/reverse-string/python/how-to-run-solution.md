To run the Reverse a String in Python program, grab a copy of the Python file
from GitHub. After that, get the latest version of Python. Now, all you have to
do is run the following from the command line:

```console
python reverse-string.py "Hello, World!"
```

Alternatively, you can always copy the source code into an online Python
interpreter. Just make sure you pass some input to your script before you run
it.
