First, make sure you have Lua installed on your local machine. You can read about how to do that here: [Getting started with Lua](https://www.lua.org/start.html).

Once you have Lua installed, you can download the `reverse-string.lua` file from this repo ([here](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/master/archive/l/lua/reverse-string.lua)).

Save that file wherever you like, then open a terminal or command prompt to that directory.

There you should be able to run the following:

```sh
lua reverse-string.lua fibonacci
```

And see the following output:

```sh
iccanobif
```
