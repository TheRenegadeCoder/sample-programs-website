If we're looking to run this program, perhaps the first thing we should do is
download the solution from GitHub. Then, we'll need to get the latest version of
Java. At that point, all we have to do is run the following from the command line:

```console
javac ReverseString.java
java ReverseString "Hello, World!"
```

The first line compiles the code while the second line runs the binary. In this
case, we're trying to reverse "Hello, World!"

Alternatively, we can run the Reverse a String in Java solution using an online
Java compiler. Just copy the solution into the developing pane, add a string to
the command line arguments, and hit run.
