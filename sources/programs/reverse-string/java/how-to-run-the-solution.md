If we're looking to run this program, perhaps the first thing we should do is
[download the solution from GitHub](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/main/archive/j/java/ReverseString.java). Then, we'll need to get the latest version of
Java. At that point, all we have to do is run the following from the command line:

```console
javac ReverseString.java
java ReverseString "Hello, World!"
```

The first line compiles the code while the second line runs the binary. In this
case, we're trying to reverse "Hello, World!"

Alternatively, we can run the Reverse a String in Java solution using an [online
Java compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler). Just copy the solution into the developing pane, add a string to
the command line arguments, and hit run.
