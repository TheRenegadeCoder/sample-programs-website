If we want to run this program, we should probably download a copy of Binary Search in Python.
After that, we should make sure we have the latest Python interpreter.
From there, we can run the following command in the terminal:

`python binary_search.py "1, 4, 5, 11, 12" "11"`

Alternatively, we can copy the solution into an online Python interpreter and hit run then you need to modify `sys.argv[i]` to your inputs.
