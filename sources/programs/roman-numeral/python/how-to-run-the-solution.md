If we want to run this program, we should probably download a copy of [Roman Numeral in Python][1].
After that, we should make sure we have the [latest Python interpreter][2].
From there, we can run the following command in the terminal:

`python roman_numeral.py "XIV"`

Alternatively, we can copy the solution into an [online Python interpreter][3] and hit run then you need to modify `sys.argv[1]` to your inputs.
