An odd-even program is a computer program designed to determine whether an integer is even or odd. In this program, the number entered as input will be checked, and the result will show whether the number is divisible by 2 (even) or not (odd). This program is usually used in software development, web programming, or other applications that require data processing based on number properties. This is an example of a simple program that can provide basic information about the properties of numbers for certain purposes.

Here is the code:
```php

<?php
// Define a function to check if a number is even or odd
function checkEvenOdd($number) {
    if ($number % 2 == 0) {
        echo "$number is even.";
    } else {
        echo "$number is odd.";
    }
}

// Test the function with a number
$number = 7; // You can change this number to test different values

// Call the function to check if the number is even or odd
checkEvenOdd($number);
?>

```

The PHP code that you provided is a simple program that functions to check whether a number is even or odd.
