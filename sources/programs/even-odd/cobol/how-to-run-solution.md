To run the solution we will need [a COBOL compiler](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) installed and [the actual code file](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/main/archive/c/cobol/even-odd.cbl).
Finally we need to run these commands in order:

```console
cobc -x even-odd.cbl
$ ./even-odd
```
The commands first compile the source code into an executable and then execute it.
Alternatively, you might want to use an [online COBOL compiler](https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-cobol-online/)
