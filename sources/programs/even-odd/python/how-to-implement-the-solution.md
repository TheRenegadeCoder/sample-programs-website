Let's look at the code in detail:  

Here we have a function called `even_odd` that returns "Even" if a number is even and "Odd" if it is odd. We are checking this using the modulus operator (%) which returns the remainder after division. The result after a modulo operation of an even integer will always be 0 while the result after a modulo operation of an odd integer will always be 1.

Ex.
* 14 % 2 => 0 (14 / 2 is 7 with no remainder)
* 15 % 2 => 1 (15 / 2 is 7 with a remainder of 1)
