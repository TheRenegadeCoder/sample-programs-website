If we want to run this program, we should probably download a copy of
Hello World in Python. After that, we should make sure we have the
[latest Python interpreter][1]. From there, we can simply run the following
command in the terminal:

```console
python even-odd.py <input>
```

With <input> being any integer. For example

```console
python even-odd.py 12
```

Alternatively, we can copy the solution into an [online Python interpreter][2]
and hit run.
