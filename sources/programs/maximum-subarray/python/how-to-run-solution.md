If you want to run this program, you can download a copy of [Maximum Subarray in Python](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/master/archive/p/python/maximum_subarray.py).

Next, make sure you have the latest Python interpreter (latest stable version of Python 3 will do).

Finally, open a terminal in the directory of the downloaded file and run the following command:

`python maximum_subarray.py 1,2,3,4`

Replace `1,2,3,4` with input of your choice(comma separated integers)

Alternatively, copy the solution into an online [Python interpreter](https://colab.research.google.com) and hit run.
