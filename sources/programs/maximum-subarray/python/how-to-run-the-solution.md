If you want to run this program, you can download a copy of [Maximum Subarray in Python](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/main/archive/p/python/maximum_subarray.py).

Next, make sure you have the [latest Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Finally, open a terminal in the directory of the downloaded file and run the following command:

`python maximum_subarray.py 1,2,3,4`

Replace `1,2,3,4` with input of your choice (comma separated integers).

Alternatively, copy the solution into an online [Python interpreter](https://www.online-python.com/) and hit run.
