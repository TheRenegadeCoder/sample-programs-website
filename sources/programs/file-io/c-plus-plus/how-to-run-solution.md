There are many online compilers such as Compiler Explorer that you can use to
compile C++ code. If you have a compiler installed on your system such g++ or
clang++ use the following commands:

```console
g++ -o program file.cpp
clang++ -o program file.cpp
```

And, that's it! You've successfully executed the solution.
