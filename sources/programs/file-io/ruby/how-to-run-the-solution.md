Websites like Repl allow you to write and run code of different programming
languages in the browser. Feel free to drop our solution into one of your

If you have Ruby installed on your computer/mac, you can run the following command:

```console
ruby file-io.rb
```

To verify everything has worked correctly, you should see the contents of the
