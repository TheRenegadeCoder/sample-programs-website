If we want to run this program, we should probably download a copy of [Selection Sort in Python](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/main/archive/p/python/selection_sort.py).
After that, we should make sure we have the [latest Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/). From there, we can run the following command in the terminal:

`python selection-sort.py "3, 2, 10, 6, 1, 7"`

Alternatively, we can copy the solution into an [online Python interpreter](https://www.online-python.com/) and hit run.
