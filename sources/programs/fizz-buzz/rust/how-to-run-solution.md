To run FizzBuzz in Rust, install the latest version of Rust. After that, create a project structure using `cargo`:

```console
cargo new fizz-buzz
```

Copy the code from Github into 'main.rs'. Compile and run the code from the command line using

```console
cargo run main.rs
```

This will create a new 'target' directory containing the executable binary file.
