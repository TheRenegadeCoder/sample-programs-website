To run the Fizz Buzz in Python program, grab a copy of the Python file from GitHub.
After that, get the latest version of Python. Now, all you have to do is run the
following from the command line:

```console
python fizz-buzz.py
```

Alternatively, you can always copy the source code into an online Python
interpreter and hit run.
