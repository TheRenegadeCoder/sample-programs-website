### In the Browser

To try out this script just copy it, open the dev tools of your Browser (F12 by default in most cases), head to the `console` tab, paste in the script and press enter to run it.

### Node.js

Download and install `Node.js`.
Save the script in, for example, `index.js` and from the same directory open a console of your choice (cmd, powershell, bash, etc.) and run `node index.js`.
Hint: Depending on your operating system the node binary might be called slightly different for example on some linux distributions, you'd need to type `nodejs index.js` instead.
