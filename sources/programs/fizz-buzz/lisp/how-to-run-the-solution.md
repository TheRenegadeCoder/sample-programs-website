There are many options for running the code, though make sure to be using a CLisp based tool.

To run on a local machine, we can download a copy of [Steel Bank Common Lisp][1]
as well as a copy of the solution. Assuming SBCL is in the path,
we can run a lisp file like a script as follows:

```
sbcl --script fizz-buzz.lsp
```

For an easy online interpreter, here are some options:

- [CompileOnline CLISP][2]
- [Jdoodle CLISP][3]
