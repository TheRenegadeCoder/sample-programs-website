First we will need to grab the latest version of Java, particularly the Java
Development Kit (JDK). Next we need to save the code into a file named
`FizzBuzz.java`. Finally, in the folder with the code, we shall run the commands:

```console
javac FizzBuzz.java
java FizzBuzz
```

There are plenty of online compilers available as well.
