As usual, you're free to use an online Python interpreter such as the one on
Repl and run the solution there. Alternatively, if you have a Python interpreter
installed on your machine, you can use the following command:

```console
python file-input-output.py
```

After you execute this command, you should be able to find a nearby `output.txt`
file containing the arbitrary text we used earlier. If so, you've successfully
run the program.
