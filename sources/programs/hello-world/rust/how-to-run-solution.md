As always, we can try out this code using an [online Rust compiler][5]. All we
need to do is drop the code into the editor and hit run.

Alternatively, we can [download the latest Rust compiler][6] and a [copy of the solution][7].
Then, assuming the compiler is in the path, navigate to folder with the solution and run
the following in Windows:

```console
rustc hello-world.rs
hello-world.exe
```

Of course, in Unix-based environments, the following will run the new binary:

```console
./hello-world
```

And, that’s it! “Hello, World!” should print directly to the console.
