At any rate, I think we're done here. If we want to try to run the solution, we
can plug some of this code into an [online Racket interpreter][1].

Alternatively, we can [download the latest version of Racket][2] and [get a copy of
the solution][3]. Assuming Racket is now in the path, we can just run the following
to execute Hello World in Racket:

```shell
racket hello-world.rkt
```

And, that's it. If successful, the "Hello, World!" string should print to the console.
