At any rate, I think we’re done here. If we want to try to run the solution, we
can plug some of this code into an online Racket interpreter.

Alternatively, we can download the latest version of Racket and get a copy of
the solution. Assuming Racket is now in the path, we can just run the following
to execute Hello World in Racket:

```shell
racket hello-world.rkt
```

And, that’s it. If successful, the “Hello, World!” string should print to the console.
