Now, if we want to run the solution, we’ll need to [get a hold of a C compiler][1].
In addition, we’ll probably want to [get a copy of Hello World in C][2]. With both
prerequisites out of the way, all we have to do is navigate to our file and run
the following commands from the command line:

```console
gcc -o hello-world hello-world.c
./hello-world
```

Of course, these are Unix/Linux instructions. If we’re on Windows, it may be easier
to take advantage of an [online C compiler][3]. Alternatively, we can leverage a tool
like [MinGW][4].
