As usual, we can give it a go with an [online Scheme interpreter][1]. Just drop the code above into the editor and hit run.

Alternatively, we can download [CHICKEN Scheme][2] and a copy of the solution. Assuming CHICKEN Scheme is on our path, we can run the following from a command line:

```bash
csi -s hello-world.scm
```
That will run the Scheme file as a script which will quickly print the "Hello, World!" string.
