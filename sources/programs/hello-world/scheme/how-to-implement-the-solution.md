If you checked out the tutorial on Hello World in Lisp, then this should be easy. First things first, we have the *display* function. The *display* function works exactly as you would expect. It takes some input and displays it to the user.

As a result, it's natural to expect that the input in this case is Hello World. All we do is pass the Hello World string to display, and we're done.
