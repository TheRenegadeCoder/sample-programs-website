There’s no time to waste! Let’s dig right into Hello World 
in Pascal:

```pascal
program HelloWorld(output);
begin
  writeln('Hello, World!');
end.
```

As usual, we’ll tackle this implementation line by line. Up 
first, we have the program line which declares the name of 
the program and a list of file descriptors.

Up next, we have our main block which is denoted by the begin 
and end keywords. Within this block, we have the print statement. 
Of course, the function we use in Pascal is called writeln.

Finally, we have a period, also known as a full stop. This 
indicates the end of the program.

As an added tidbit, semicolons mark the ends of statements, but 
they are optional on the last statement in a block. In other words, 
we could have removed the semicolon after the writeln command.
