If we want to try any of the Pascal code snippets from this article, 
we can use an online Pascal compiler. We just need to drop the snippets 
into the online editor and hit run.

Of course, we can always download and install Pascal locally. While 
we’re downloading stuff, we should probably get a copy of the solution.

Assuming Pascal is now in our path, we can navigate to our folder 
containing the solution and run the following commands from the terminal:

```shell
fpc hello-world.p
hello-world.exe  # Windows
./hello-world  # Unix/Linux/Mac
```

Since Pascal is a compiled language, we first need to compile our script. 
After compilation, we’ll have an executable we can run. When we run it, the 
“Hello, World!” string should print to the console.
