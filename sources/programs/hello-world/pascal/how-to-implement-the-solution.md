Let's dig right into Hello World in Pascal.

As usual, we'll tackle this implementation line by line. Up
first, we have the program line which declares the name of
the program and a list of file descriptors.

Up next, we have our main block which is denoted by the `begin`
and `end` keywords. Within this block, we have the print statement.
Of course, the function we use in Pascal is called `writeln`.

Finally, we have a period, also known as a full stop. This
indicates the end of the program.

As an added tidbit, semicolons mark the ends of statements, but 
they are optional on the last statement in a block. In other words, 
we could have removed the semicolon after the writeln command.
