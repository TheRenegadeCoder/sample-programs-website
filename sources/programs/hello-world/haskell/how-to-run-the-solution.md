If we want to run the snippets above, we can use an online Haskell compiler. All we 
have to do is drop the code into the editor and hit run.

Of course, we can also run the code locally if we just grab a copy of the latest Glasgow 
Haskell Compiler. While we’re downloading stuff, we should probably get a copy of the 
solution.

Assuming Haskell is now in the path, we can compile and run our solution using the 
following commands:

```shell
ghc hello-world.hs
hello-world.exe  # Windows
./hello-world  # Unix/Linux/Mac
```

And, that’s it! The “Hello, World!” string should print straight to the console.
