If we want to run the snippets above, we can use an [online Haskell compiler][1]. All we 
have to do is drop the code into the editor and hit run.

Of course, we can also run the code locally if we just grab a copy of the latest Glasgow 
Haskell Compiler. While we're downloading stuff, we should probably get a copy of the 
solution.

Assuming Haskell is now in the path, we can compile and run our solution using the 
following commands:

```shell
ghc hello-world.hs
hello-world.exe  # Windows
./hello-world  # Unix/Linux/Mac
```

And, that's it! The "Hello, World!" string should print straight to the console.
