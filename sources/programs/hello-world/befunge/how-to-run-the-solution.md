Because of the particular design of the language, your best option is a Befunge interpreter. This is both for availability and because watching it run is the only way to really understand (or debug) it.

- [Befunge Playground][2]
- [jsFunge IDE][3]
- [Befunge-93 Interpreter][4]

There are compilers as well, even through the technical challenges:

- [BefunUtils][6]

For a much more thorough look at Befunge, it's list of operators, and its various derivatives, I recommend the [Esolang Wiki][7].
