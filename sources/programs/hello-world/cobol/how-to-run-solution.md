To run the solution we will need [a COBOL compiler][1] installed and of the course [the actual code file][2].
Finally we need to run these commands in order:

```console
cobc -x hello-world.cbl
$ ./hello-world
```
The commands first compile the source code into an executable and then execute it.
Alternatively, you might want to use an [online COBOL compiler][3]
