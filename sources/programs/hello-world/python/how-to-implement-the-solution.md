I chose Python to start as it has probably the easiest and most readable 
Hello World implementation in the realm of programming languages.

We don't even have to compile anything. If we're in 
the interpreter, we'll print right away. Otherwise, we can easily call the 
script from the command line to get our result.

As you can probably imagine, this code works because Python has a built-in 
function called *print*. By passing that function a string, the interpreter 
is able to call the Python libraries that make the print possible.
