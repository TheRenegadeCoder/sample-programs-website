If we want to run this program, we should probably download a copy of 
Hello World in Python. After that, we should make sure we have the 
[latest Python interpreter][1]. From there, we can simply run the following 
command in the terminal:

```console
python hello-world.py
```

Alternatively, we can copy the solution into an [online Python interpreter][2] 
and hit run.
