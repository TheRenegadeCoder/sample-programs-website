If we want to run this program, we should probably download a copy of
[Hello World in Python][1]. After that, we should make sure we have the
[latest Python interpreter][2]. From there, we can simply run the following
command in the terminal:

```console
python hello-world.py
```

Alternatively, we can copy the solution into an [online Python interpreter][3]
and hit run.
