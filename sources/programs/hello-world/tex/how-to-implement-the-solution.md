At any rate, let's dive right into Hello World in Tex:

```tex
%&pdftex

Hello, World!
\end
```
It is much simpler in Tex due to the fact the Tex is a markup language.

```tex
%&pdftex
```
This first line is a declaring line used to explain that the desired output of this tex file is a pdf.

```tex
Hello, World!
```
This is the body better known as what will be displayed. You could replace that text with anything to have it show up.

```tex
\end
```
Finally, this is saying the document has ended by declaring(`\`) an `end`.
