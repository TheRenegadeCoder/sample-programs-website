There are many options for running Tex files both online and offline. This said my personal favorite option is running it online through [Overleaf][1]. Here is what you will need to do:

1. You will need to create an account (if you do not already have one).
2. Click on the `Project` button.
3. Select `Create New Project`, and select `Blank Project`.
4. Call the project `Hello World`, and click the `Create` button.
5. Select all the code in the `Code Editor` field, and delete it.
6. Copy the [Hello World in Tex][3] sample and paste it into the `Code Editor` field.
7. Click the `Recompile` button.
8. Since this sample does not generate a PDF file, you will have to scroll down to the bottom, click
   on the `Other Files` button, and select `hello-world.txt`. This will download the file to your
   computer. If you open that file, you will see `Hello, World!`.

[Overleaf][1] even covers the other options including themselves on their website [here][2].
