With our solution implemented, we should probably give it a run. Perhaps the easiest 
way to run the solution is to copy it into an online VB.NET compiler.

Alternatively, we can run the solution using Microsoft’s very own Visual Studio. 
Of course, I’m not sure of it’s support on platforms beyond Windows. Don’t forget 
to grab a copy of the Hello World in Visual Basic .NET solution.
