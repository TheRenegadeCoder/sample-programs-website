With our solution implemented, we should probably give it a run. Perhaps the easiest 
way to run the solution is to copy it into an [online VB.NET compiler][1].

Alternatively, we can run the solution using Microsoft's very own Visual Studio. 
Of course, I'm not sure of it's support on platforms beyond Windows. Don't forget 
to grab a copy of the [Hello World in Visual Basic .NET][2] solution.
