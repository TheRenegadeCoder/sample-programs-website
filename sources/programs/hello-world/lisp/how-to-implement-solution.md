Unfortunately, Lisp has many flavors which means the following implementation 
of Hello World will likely only be applicable to handful of those flavors:

```lisp
(format t "Hello, World!")
```

That said, Iâ€™m happy to dig into this implementation of Hello World in Lisp.

First things first, we have the format keyword. In Common Lisp, format is 
basically the equivalent to printf in C. It basically takes some string and 
outputs it to some destination.

That brings us to this mysterious letter t. According to gigamonkeys, t is 
actually the destination of the output. More specifically, t indicates standard 
output. Another option is NIL which causes the string to be returned.

Finally, we have our Hello World string. This is obviously what gets printed 
to standard output.
