If we’re looking to run this solution, perhaps the easiest way to do so
is to [download the latest Red toolchain][2]. Of course, we’ll also want
to grab a copy of the [Hello World script from GitHub][3].

Now, drop both of those files in the same folder and run the following:

```console
red hello-world.red
```

If you’re a Windows user, you may need to call the executable directly.

In addition, we can compile our script using the following command:

```console
red -c hello-world.red
```

At this point, I would usually share some online editor you could use to test
code, but Red doesn’t appear to have one. If one exists, let me know in
the comments.
