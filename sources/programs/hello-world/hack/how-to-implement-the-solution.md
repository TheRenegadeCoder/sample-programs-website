At long last, let's take a stab at Hello World in Hack.

Right away, you should scream "that looks a lot like PHP!" 
After all, Hack is just a dialect of PHP.

That said, there is at least one obvious syntactic difference: 
the Hack tag. I can't seem to figure out the formal name of 
the `<?hh` tag, so I've been calling it the Hack tag. At any 
rate, at least that's different.

Beyond the tag, Hello World in Hack is exactly the same in Hello 
World in PHP. However, I will point out that you can't mix HTML 
with Hack like you can with PHP, so that's probably the biggest 
syntactic difference. Otherwise, both languages perform a similar 
function: backend web development.
