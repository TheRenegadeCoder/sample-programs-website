Now, let’s see how we can print a simple “Hello World” in Koka:

```koka
function main()
{
  println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Just like many other programming languages, the main function is the starting
point of the code execution. To print, we use println, a built-in method that
prints a given string or variable to the console.

Like many of the high-level language implementations in this series, this one
wasn’t too bad. Wanna try it out? Check out this [online Koka editor][1].
