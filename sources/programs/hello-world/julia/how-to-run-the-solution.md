With our solution ready, we probably want to run it. Perhaps the easiest
thing to do would be to take advantage of [Julia's online editor][1].
Unfortunately, it appears sign up is required to use it, but it's great
for running some code snippets.

Alternatively, we can [download the latest version of Julia][2]. While we're
at it, we should probably get a copy of the Hello World in Julia solution.
With everything read to go, navigate the command line to the folder
containing the solution. Then, run the following:

```shell
julia hello-world.jl
```

That should execute the script. Don't be afraid to leverage the Julia 
documentation if you get stuck.
