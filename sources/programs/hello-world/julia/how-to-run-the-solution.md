With our solution ready, we probably want to run it. Perhaps the easiest 
thing to do would be to take advantage of Julia’s online editor. 
Unfortunately, it appears sign up is required to use it, but it’s great 
for running some code snippets.

Alternatively, we can download the latest version of Julia. While we’re 
at it, we should probably get a copy of the Hello World in Julia solution. 
With everything read to go, navigate the command line to the folder 
containing the solution. Then, run the following:

```shell
julia hello-world.jl
```

That should execute the script. Don’t be afraid to leverage the Julia 
documentation if you get stuck.[^grifski_hwjulia_2018]
