At any rate, let’s get right to our implementation of Hello 
World in Wren:

```wren
System.print("Hello, World!")
```

And, that’s it! Personally, I’m getting hints of Java and 
Python here just in terms of syntax.

At any rate, let’s break it down. Obviously, we only have 
one line, but it’s at least a little more interesting than 
most scripting languages.

For starters, we have the built-in System class. This class 
comes with the core module along with a few other goodies like 
String, Sequence, Fiber, and Bool.

Now, one of the functions of System is print. Obviously, print 
writes text to standard output. But, I find Wren’s print 
functionality particularly interesting because it’s similar to 
Java. In fact, it accepts any object as input. If the input is 
not a String, print will convert it to a String using the 
toString functionality, a method available to all objects.

So, basically we call the static method print of the System class 
which prints the input to the user. How cool is that?
