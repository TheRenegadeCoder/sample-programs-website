At any rate, let’s get down to business:

```lua
print("Hello, World!")
```

As we’ll quickly notice, Hello World in Lua is not that exciting. In fact, there
are only a handful of languages with this boring of an implementation. For
instance, both Ruby and Python can perform Hello World in a similar fashion.
As a result, there’s not a ton of explaining that needs to be done.

Essentially, Lua has a native printing function which can be used to write a
string to stdout. In this case, it’s called print, but the developers could
have just as easily called it put, write, println, or puts. If you know of any
other fun print function names, let me know in the comments.

As usual, we pass a string to the print function, and the function handles the
rest.
