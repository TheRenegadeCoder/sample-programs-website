Let's get down to business.

As we'll quickly notice, Hello World in Lua is not that exciting. In fact, there
are only a handful of languages with this boring of an implementation. For
instance, both Ruby and Python can perform Hello World in a similar fashion.
As a result, there's not a ton of explaining that needs to be done.

Essentially, Lua has a native printing function which can be used to write a
string to stdout. In this case, it's called `print`, but the developers could
have just as easily called it `put`, `write`, `println`, or `puts`.

As usual, we pass a string to the `print` function, and the function handles the
rest.
