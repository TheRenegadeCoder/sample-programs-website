Well, perhaps running the script will be more interesting. Fortunately for us,
there’s [an online REPL for Lua][2], so we don’t have to worry about downloading
anything. Once inside, drop the code snippet from above into the editor and hit
run. That’s it!

Alternatively, we could [download a copy of Lua][3], and run the solution locally.
Even better, we could build a Docker image, so we don’t clutter our machine with
dependencies. If you want to help with the Docker initiative, head on over to
the Sample Programs repository and fork it. We appreciate the help!
