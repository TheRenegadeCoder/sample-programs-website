To print 'Hello World!' in Rexx, we need to take note of two points:

- the program starts with a comment line to identify it as a REXX program. Hence, comments are added between /* */.
- use SAY command before the desired output or value

So, let's get to the point and see how to implement the solution:

```REXX
/* Print 'Hello-World!' sample program in REXX */
SAY 'Hello World!'
```

And that's it! It is a very simple one-liner program with a few specifications. The comments tell us what the program does and the intruction 'say' is used to print the program 'Hello World!'.

'SAY' is a basic command to print output on the same lines as 'PRINT' from Python. It remains constant regardless of the version.
