Let's get down to business, Hello World in Kotlin.

On the first line, we have the `package` declaration. Like most
languages, this basically declares the package or module name
of this file. If anyone needed to use a function in this file,
they could access it via the package name.

Next, we have the function definition. In this first line, we
can see we define the `main` function which receives an array of
`String`s as input. In a lot of languages, types are declared in
type-var order, not in Kotlin. In Kotlin, we declare the variable
name before giving it a type.

Finally, we print Hello World in Kotlin. Like many languages, 
we use a simple call to the `println` function, so no surprises there.
