Anyway, let’s get down to business—Hello World in Kotlin:

```kotlin
package hello
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  println("Hello, World!")
}
```
  
Now, time to dig in!

On the first line, we have the package declaration. Like most 
languages, this basically declares the package or module name 
of this file. If anyone needed to use a function in this file, 
they could access it via the package name.

Next, we have the function definition. In this first line, we 
can see we define the main function which receives an array of 
Strings as input. In a lot of languages, types are declared in 
type-var order, not in Kotlin. In Kotlin, we declare the variable 
name before giving it a type.

Finally, we print Hello World in Kotlin. Like many languages, 
we use a simple call to the println function, so no surprises there.
