Running our program is a relatively simple affair. First, the script must be
saved [using the MATLAB editor][1]. File > Save or CNTL+S will do the trick, and it
will generate a file with the extension `*.m` (yep, only one character). After
that, hit run and watch as our polite greeting to our surroundings populates
the screen.

If you want to try this out yourself, you can get a 30 day free trial of MATLAB,
download the [program sample file][4] and run the script! Note, if you are a
university student, your school may have licenses of MATLAB available to you.

Alternatively, you can try to use [Octave Online][2], an open-source alternative to
MATLAB. [According to its wiki page][3], Octave is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
In fact, our solution to Hello World in MATLAB works great.
