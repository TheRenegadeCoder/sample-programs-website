Syntax in MATLAB is based on its MATLAB scripting language. At any rate, here
is what we are working with:

```matlab
fprintf("Hello, World!")
```

One line is all it takes! The “details-hidden” nature of the languages removes
the need to declare variables or classes before the fun begins. `fprintf` is the
command in MATLAB that formats data and displays it in the command window. In
this case, the data is the string “Hello, World!” (denoted by the
quotations).
