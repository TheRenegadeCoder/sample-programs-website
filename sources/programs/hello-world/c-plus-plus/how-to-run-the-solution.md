Perhaps the easiest way to run the solution is to leverage the [online gdb compiler][1].

Alternatively, you can try to run the C++ code in a similar way described 
in the last article. Honestly, it's pretty easy to write and run C/C++ code 
on most platforms:

```console
gcc -o hello-world hello-world.cpp
./hello-world
```

Unfortunately, Windows pretty much requires the use of Visual Studio. So, 
instead of sharing platform specific directions, I'll fallback on my online 
compiler recommendation.
