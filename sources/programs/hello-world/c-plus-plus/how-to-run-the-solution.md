Perhaps the easiest way to run the solution is to leverage the online gdb 
compiler.

Alternatively, you can try to run the C++ code in a similar way described 
in the last article. Honestly, it's pretty easy to write and run C/C++ code 
on most platforms:

```console
gcc -o reverse-string reverse-string.cpp
```

Unfortunately, Windows pretty much requires the use of Visual Studios. So, 
instead of sharing platform specific directions, I'll fallback on my online 
compiler recommendation. Let me know if you have questions otherwise in the 
comments.
