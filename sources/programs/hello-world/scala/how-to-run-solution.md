If we want to try the code above, we can use an online Scala compiler. Just 
take the code above and drop it into the editor before hitting run.

Alternatively, we can always try to run the code locally. First, we’ll need 
to follow the directions when downloading and installing Scala. Then, we’ll 
probably want to get a copy of the solution.

With the heavy lifting out of the way, we should be able to simply run the 
following commands from the command line:

```shell
scalac hello-world.scala
scala hello-world
```

As we can see, Scala can be executed in pretty much the same way as Java. If 
all goes well, the last command should print the “Hello, World!” string.
