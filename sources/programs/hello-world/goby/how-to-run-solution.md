To run this solution, we can take advantage of the samplerunner script
included in the [Sample Programs repo][2]. If our system is setup
correctly, the following command should get the job done:

```shell
./samplerunner.sh run -s hello-world.gb
```

Alternatively, we may want to get a copy of the Goby interpreter. [According
to the documentation][1], there are a few ways to do that, but we won't 
dig into that now.

Unlike many other languages in this collection, Goby does not have an online 
interpreter at this time.
