As seen many times in this collection, Hello World in Goby is actually
really simple. In total, it's one line of code which looks a lot like
Ruby.

Alternatively, we can leave out the parentheses:

```goby
puts "Hello, World!"
```

Naturally, `puts` writes the "Hello, World!" string to the user, and that's it!
