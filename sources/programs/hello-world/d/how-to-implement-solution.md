At any rate, let’s get to the implementation of Hello World in D:

```d
import std.stdio;
void main()
{
    writeln("Hello, World!");
}
```

At this point, you may be questioning whether or not D is even a new 
language. After all, this Hello World implementation looks a lot like 
C/C++.

Well, then it should come as no surprise the solution is pretty much 
the same. We have basically three main parts: the import statement, 
the main function, and the print function.

Just like C/C++, the first thing we do is import our standard output 
library. In this case, D references std.stdio as opposed to stdio.h 
in C.

Up next, we have our usual main function. At this point in the series, 
we’re pretty use to this syntax.

Finally, we have our typical print function. In this case, we call 
writeln and pass a string to it.
