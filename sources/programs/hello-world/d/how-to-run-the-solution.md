If we wanted to run our code snippet from above, we can leverage an 
[online D compiler][1].

Alternatively, we can download our own D compiler from the official 
website. Then, we'll want to get a copy of Hello World in D. After 
that, we can simply run the following:

```shell
rdmd hello-world.d
```

And, that's it! The string "Hello, World!" should appear in the console.
