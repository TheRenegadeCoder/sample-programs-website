At any rate, let’s implement Hello World in Bash:

```bash
echo Hello, World!
```

Or, if we want to be a bit more verbose:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo Hello, World!
```

As we can see, printing “Hello, World!” in Bash is quite simple. All we do is call the 
echo command to print the string.

As an added note, the shebang (#!) tells the environment how to run the script. 
In this case, we want to run the script using Bash. But, we can use this same 
notation for other languages as well:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print("Hello, World!")
```

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts "Hello, World!"
```

```node
#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log("Hello, World!")
```

Here, we have Hello World in Python, Ruby, and Node.js, respectively. Each of these 
scripting languages can leverage the shebang syntax for easy execution in Unix, Linux, 
and Mac environments.
