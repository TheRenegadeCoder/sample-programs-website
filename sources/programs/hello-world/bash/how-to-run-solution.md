If we want to run the solution, we can easily leverage an online Bash shell. To use 
the tool, we just have to drop our solution into the editor and hit run.

```console
./hello-world.sh
```

In fact, even Windows 10 users can leverage Bash. How-To Geek has a nice tutorial 
on how to use Bash on Windows 10. If that sounds interesting, check it out!
