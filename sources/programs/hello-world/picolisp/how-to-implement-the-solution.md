Without further ado, let’s implement Hello World in PicoLisp:

```picolisp
(prinl "Hello, World!")'
```

And, perhaps unsurprisingly, that’s it! With a single line, we can print Hello 
World in PicoLisp.

Of course, let’s break down what’s happening. Since PicoLisp is a dialect of 
Lisp, we can expect a ton of parentheses. In fact, our solution requires a single 
set of parentheses at a minimum.

Inside the parentheses, we have a function call. In this case, the print function 
is named prinl and the input is our “Hello, World!” string. When executed, our 
string will print to the console.
