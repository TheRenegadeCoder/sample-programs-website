Let's break down what's happening. Since PicoLisp is a dialect of
Lisp, we can expect a ton of parentheses. In fact, our solution requires a single
set of parentheses at a minimum.

Inside the parentheses, we have a function call. In this case, the print function
is named `prinl`, and the input is our "Hello, World!" string. When executed, our
string will print to the console. The `bye` function is required to exit the program.
