If we want to run the solution, we can try an online editor. However, I ran into some 
problems with this particular editor.

Alternatively, if we have access to a Unix, Linux, or Mac machine, we can easily 
download and install the latest version of PicoLisp. That said, @cess11 has a great 
video proving that this solution works:

And, that’s it! If implemented correctly, the solution should print “Hello, World!” to the console.
