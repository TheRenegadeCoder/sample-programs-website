Letâ€™s get something working! ðŸ˜Š

```powershell
Write-Host 'Hello, World!'
```

To execute this code, open a [PowerShell][1] console on any Windows machine as it
comes installed by default. Youâ€™ll see the reply output in the window like so:

```console
[20:35:40]:Alcha$ Write-Host 'Hello, World!'
Hello, World!
[20:35:56]:Alcha$
```

As is the case with most modern scripting languages, getting a Hello World
sample running is really easy.
