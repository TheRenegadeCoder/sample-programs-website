If we want to run our solution, perhaps the easiest thing to do is to copy our solution 
into the [online Crystal editor][2]. After that, we can hit run to see the output.

Alternatively, we can try to install the compiler on our system. However, I won't bother 
going into that because I'm using a Windows PC which doesn't appear to be supported.
