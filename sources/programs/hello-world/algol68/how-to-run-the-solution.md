Perhaps the easiest way to run the solution is to use an [online ALGOL 68 editor][2]. 
If we copy the solution above into the editor, we can hit execute to run it.

Alternatively, we have the option to install an ALGOL 68 interpreter. Apparently, there 
is a limited [ALGOL 68 Genie interpreter][3] which should get the job done. After all, 
itâ€™s the same interpreter the online solution uses. Feel free to leverage the 
[documentation][4].
