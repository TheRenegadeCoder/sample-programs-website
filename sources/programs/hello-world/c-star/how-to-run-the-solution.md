The compiler source can be found in the [C* GitHub repository][1]. To build it,
just follow the [build from source instructions][2] for your particular OS.
Once, you've built the compiler, download a copy of the [Hello World in C* sample][3].
Then, build and run the program like this:

```
cx -o hello-world hello-world.cx
./hello-world
```
