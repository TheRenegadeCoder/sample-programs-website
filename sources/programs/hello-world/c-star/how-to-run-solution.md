Unfortunately, I haven’t found a way to execute C* programs. That said, I did
find a handful of open-source C* compilers, so maybe those can help us out:

- <https://github.com/KayvanMazaheri/c-star-compiler>
- <https://github.com/renjithgr/cstar-compiler-Java>

In addition, the [user guide][1] does detail how to compile and run C* programs. But,
again, that information isn’t super helpful without the compiler.

If you know of an official compiler, let me know in the comments.
