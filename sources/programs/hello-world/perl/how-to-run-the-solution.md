As usual, we can try the solution using an [online Perl interpreter][1]. All we 
have to do is drop the code into the editor and hit run.

As an alternative, we can always run Perl locally. First, we'll need to get 
the latest version of Perl from the [official website][2]. After that, we should 
probably get a copy of the solution. Assuming Perl is now in our path, we can 
get to work:

```shell
perl hello-world.pl
```

Since Perl is a scripting language, we can quickly run the script with the 
command above. If successful, "Hello, World!" should print to the console.
