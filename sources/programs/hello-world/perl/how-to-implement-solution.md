Without further ado, let’s dive straight into our implementation 
of Hello World in Perl:

```perl
print "Hello, World!";
```

Well, that was anticlimactic. In fact, it was about as disappointing 
as our implementations of Hello World in Python and Ruby. That said, 
who doesn’t love a simple implementation (talking to you, Java).

At any rate, let’s dig into this a little bit. For starters, we’ll 
notice there are no parentheses required for Perl’s print function. 
I use the word “required” because we can actually call print with them:

```perl
print("Hello, World!");
```

However, from my understanding, it’s good Perl style to omit the parentheses 
for built-in functions.

Oh, I should probably clarify something. In Perl, they’re not called 
functions. Instead, they’re called subroutines, and you can declare one 
of your own using the sub keyword. That’s a new one for me!
