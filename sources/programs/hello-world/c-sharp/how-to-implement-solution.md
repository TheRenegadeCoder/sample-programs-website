Now, we can implement Hello World in C# in a couple of ways. For simplicity,
I’ll share the minimalist approach but be aware that there are more complete ways
to do this:

```csharp
class HelloWorld {
  static void Main() {
    System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
  }
}
```

If you read the Hello World in Java tutorial, then this probably looks very
similar. In fact, C# shares a lot of the same look and feel as Java. With that
being the case, I’ll only highlight the major pieces here.

Before we can print, we have to create a class. Inside our class, we declare
the main method. And inside our main method, we run our print command. The syntax
and core libraries are a little different, but it feels eerily similar to Java.
