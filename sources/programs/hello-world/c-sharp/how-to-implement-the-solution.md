Now, we can implement Hello World in C# in a couple of ways. For simplicity,
I'll share the minimalist approach but be aware that there are more complete ways
to do this.

If you read the Hello World in Java tutorial, then this probably looks very
similar. In fact, C# shares a lot of the same look and feel as Java. With that
being the case, I'll only highlight the major pieces here.

Before we can print, we have to create a class. Inside our class, we declare
the `main` method. Inside our `main` method, we run our print command. The syntax
and core libraries are a little different, but it feels eerily similar to Java.
