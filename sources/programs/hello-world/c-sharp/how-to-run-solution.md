Perhaps the easiest way to run this solution would be to open up an online C#
compiler. Just copy the code from above and drop it into the editor before
hitting run.

Alternatively, we can download Visual Studio or Mono to run C# locally. Of
course, we’ll want a copy of the solution as well. Refer to the manual of the
various tools to run C#.

As far as I know, there aren’t any easy ways to run C# code from the command
line, but I imagine it can be done.
