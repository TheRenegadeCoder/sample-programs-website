In order to run the solution we need an [R compiler][3] first. Furthermore, we need
a copy of Hello World in [R][1]. From within the directory in which we saved the copy,
we run the following command on the command line:

```console
Rscript hello-world.R        # Linux/Unix
R.exe hello-world.R          # Windows
```

Alternatively, you can try an [online compiler][4] if you want to save the time
required for installing the R environment locally.
