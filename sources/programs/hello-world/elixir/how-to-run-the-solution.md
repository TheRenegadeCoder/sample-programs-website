As always, if we want to give the code above a try, we can use an [online Elixir editor][1].
Copy the code into the editor and hit run.

Alternatively, we can run the solution locally if we download the latest 
version of [Elixir][2]. After that, we'll want to get a copy of the solution. 
Assuming Elixir is in our path, all we have to do is run the following 
commands from the command line:

```shell
elixir hello-world.ex
```

If successful, the "Hello, World" string should print to the console.
