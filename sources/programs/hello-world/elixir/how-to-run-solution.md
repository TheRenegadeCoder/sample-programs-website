As always, if we want to give the code above a try, we can use an online 
Elixir editor. Copy the code into the editor and hit run.

Alternatively, we can run the solution locally if we download the latest 
version of Elixir. After that, we’ll want to get a copy of the solution. 
Assuming Elixir is in our path, all we have to do is run the following 
commands from the command line:

```shell
elixir hello-world.ex
```

If successful, the “Hello, World” string should print to the console.
