To run on a personal computer, the ideal environment is [IntelliJ IDEA][4], as it and kotlin were both created by JetBrains.
If you decide to install the command line version however, save the program to Baklava.kt and run with these commands.

```bash
kotlinc Baklava.kt -include-runtime -d Baklava.jar
java -jar Baklava.jar
```
