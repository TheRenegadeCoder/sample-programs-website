If we want to run this program, we should probably download a copy of [Linear Search in Python](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/main/archive/p/python/linear_search.py).
After that, we should make sure we have the [latest Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
From there, we can run the following command in the terminal:

```
python linear-search.py "3, 2, 6, 1, 7" "2"
```

Alternatively, we can copy the solution into an [online Python interpreter](https://www.online-python.com/) and hit run.
