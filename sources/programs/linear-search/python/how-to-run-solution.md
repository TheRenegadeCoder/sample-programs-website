If we want to run this program, we should probably download a copy of [Linear Search in Python](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/master/archive/p/python/linear-search.py).
After that, we should make sure we have the latest Python interpreter.
From there, we can run the following command in the terminal:

`python linear-search.py 2 "3, 2, 6, 1, 7"`

Alternatively, we can copy the solution into an online Python interpreter and hit run.
