If we want to run this program, we should probably download a copy of [Bubble Sort in Go](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/master/archive/g/go/bubble-sort.go).
After that, we should make sure we have the latest Go interpreter.
From there, we can run the following command in the terminal:

`go run bubble-sort.go "3, 2, 10, 6, 1, 7"`

Alternatively, we can copy the solution into an online Go interpreter and hit run.
