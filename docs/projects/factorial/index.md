Welcome to the Factorial page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

This article was written by:

## Description

The factorial of an integer `n` is defined as:

`n! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x ... x n`

With the special case `0! = 1`.


## Requirements

You must write an executable program that accepts an integer `n` on standard
input via the command line, and outputs `n!` to standard output.

Note that the factorial function grows very quickly. For example, `4! = 24`
but `8! = 40320`. Therefore, you should impose a limit on the input, so that
the largest factorial still fits into your language's largest supported datatype.

Also note that the factorial is not defined for negative integers.


## Testing

Every project in the [Sample Programs repo](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs) should be tested.
In this section, we specify the set of tests specific to Factorial.
In order to keep things simple, we split up the testing as follows:

- Factorial Valid Tests
- Factorial Invalid Tests

### Factorial Valid Tests

| Description | Input | Output |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| Sample Input: Zero | "0" | "1" |
| Sample Input: One | "1" | "1" |
| Sample Input: Four | "4" | "24" |
| Sample Input: Eight | "8" | "40320" |
| Sample Input: Ten | "10" | "3628800" |

### Factorial Invalid Tests

| Description | Input |
| ----------- | ----- |
| No Input |  |
| Empty Input | "" |
| Invalid Input: Not A Number | "asdf" |
| Invalid Input: Negative | "-1" |

All of these tests should output the following:

```
Usage: please input a non-negative integer
```
