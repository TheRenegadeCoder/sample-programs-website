```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  if (argc < 2 || std::string(argv[1]) == "")
  {
    cout << "Usage: please input a non-negative integer" << endl;
    return 1;
  }

  int n = atoi(argv[1]);
  if (n == 0 && std::string(argv[1]) != "0")
  {
    cout << "Usage: please input a non-negative integer" << endl;
    return 1;
  }
  if(n<0)
  {
    cout << "Usage: please input a non-negative integer" << endl;
    return 1;
  }
  int i,fact=1;        
  for(i=1; i<=n; i++)
  {    
      fact=fact*i;    
  }    
  cout<<fact<<endl;  
  return 0;
}
