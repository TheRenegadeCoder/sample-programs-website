Welcome to the Remove All Whitespace page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

A string is a collection of characters. Sometimes strings contain whitespace characters like " ", "\t", and "\n". 
The purpose of this project is to remove all such spaces from a string. For example, given the string 
"Remove All Whitespace", we could generate a new string with all the whitespace removed as follows: 
"RemoveAllWhitespace". In this case, two spaces were removed at positions 6 and 10.   

For simplicity, we will be restricting the types of whitespace to these four types of characters: spaces (" "),
tabs ("\t"), newlines ("\n"), and carriage returns ("\r"). We are aware that other types of whitespace exist.
That said, programs in this collection tend to be simple, so we can replicate them in as many programming
languages as possible. 


## Requirements

To satisfy the requirements, a program must accept a string on the command line and return a new string
with all spaces removed as follows:

```shell
$ remove-all-whitespace.lang "   Hello, World!   "
$ "Hello,World!"
```

In this case, we start with a string that has leading, trailing, and inner spaces. Ultimately, we want to
return a string with all of the spaces removed.


## Testing

The following table contains various test cases that you can use to verify the correctness of your solution:

| Description                    | Input                          | Output                           |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| No Input                       |                                | "Usage: please provide a string" |
| Empty Input                    | ""                             | "Usage: please provide a string" |
| Sample Input: No Spaces        | "RemoveAllWhitespace"          | "RemoveAllWhitespace"            |
| Sample Input: Leading Spaces   | "      RemoveAllWhitespace"    | "RemoveAllWhitespace"            |
| Sample Input: Trailing Spaces  | "RemoveAllWhitespace      "    | "RemoveAllWhitespace"            |
| Sample Input: Inner Spaces     | "Remove    All   Whitespace"   | "RemoveAllWhitespace"            |
| Sample Input: Tabs             | "\tRemove\tAll\tWhitespace\t"  | "RemoveAllWhitespace"            |
| Sample Input: Newlines         | "\nRemove\nAll\nWhitespace\n"  | "RemoveAllWhitespace"            |
| Sample Input: Carriage Returns | "\rRemove\rAll\rWhitespace\r"  | "RemoveAllWhitespace"            |

As always, these tests will be run against any code submitted to the repo via [Glotter][glotter-github].
