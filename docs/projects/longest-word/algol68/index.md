Welcome to the [Longest Word](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/longest-word) in [Algol68](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/algol68) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```algol68
PROC usage = VOID: printf(($gl$, "Usage: please provide a string"));

PROC longest word length = (STRING s) INT:
(
    INT longest word len := 0;
    INT word len := 0;
    FOR n TO UPB s
    DO
        # If whitespace, reset word length #
        IF isspace(s[n])
        THEN
            word len := 0
        # Else increment word length and update longest word length #
        ELSE
            word len +:= 1;
            IF word len > longest word len
            THEN
                longest word len := word len
            FI
        FI
    OD;

    longest word len
);

# Get 1st command-line argument. Exit if empty #
STRING s := argv(4);
IF UPB s = 0
THEN
    usage;
    stop
FI;

INT longest word len := longest word length(s);
print((whole(longest word len, 0), newline))
```

{% endraw %}
