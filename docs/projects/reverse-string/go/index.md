Welcome to the [Reverse String](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/reverse-string) in [Go](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/go) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "os"

//Function to reverse a string
func reverse_string(str string) string {
    chars := []rune(str)
    for i, j := 0, len(chars)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
        chars[i], chars[j] = chars[j], chars[i]
    }
    return string(chars)
}

func main() {
    // Check the command line args length
    var argslen = len(os.Args)

    // If the length is 2, one command line arg exist
    if argslen == 2 {
        input := os.Args[1]
        fmt.Printf("%v\n", reverse_string(input))
    }
}
```

{% endraw %}
