Welcome to the [Reverse String](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/reverse-string) in [Nim](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/nim) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```nim
# For reversing a string passed in as a parameter
import os
import strutils

var text: string
try:
    text = paramStr(1)
except IndexError:
    echo "Usage: please input a string to reverse"
    quit(1)

var reversed_text: string
for i in countdown(len(text)-1, 0):
  reversed_text = reversed_text & text[i]

echo reversed_text
```

{% endraw %}
