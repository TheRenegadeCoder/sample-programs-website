Welcome to the [Reverse String](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/reverse-string) in [Fortran](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/fortran) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```fortran
program reversestring
character(len=100) :: argument
character(len=:), allocatable :: buff, reversed
integer :: i, n
call GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT(1,argument)
allocate (buff, mold=argument)
n = len(argument)
do i = 0, n - 1
    buff(n-i : n-i) = argument(i+1 : i+1)
end do
reversed = adjustl(trim(buff))
write(*,'(g0.8)')reversed
end program reversestring
```

{% endraw %}
