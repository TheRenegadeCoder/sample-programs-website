Welcome to the [Palindromic Number](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/palindromic-number) in [Mathematica](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/mathematica) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```mathematica
(* Code *)

(* This is provided by a Mathematica built-in PalindromeQ.  Only a function to provide the 'user interface' is needed: *)

palindromicNumberMain = s \[Function] Module[
    {e = "Usage: please input a non-negative integer"},
    Catch[
     Replace[
      PalindromeQ@
       (* convert string to integer, or throw *)
       If[StringMatchQ[s, DigitCharacter ..],
        FromDigits[s],
        Throw[e]],
      {False -> "false", True -> "true"}]]];


(* Valid Tests *)

Print /@ palindromicNumberMain /@ {
    "7",
    "2442",
    "232",
    "5215",
    "521"
    };


(* Invalid Tests *)

palindromicNumberMain[""]
palindromicNumberMain["a"]
palindromicNumberMain["-5"]
palindromicNumberMain["5.41"]
```

{% endraw %}
