Welcome to the Palindromic Number page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

A palindrome number is a number that reads the same backward and forward.
Example: 343, 121, 909, 222


## Requirements

Create a file called "Palindrome Number" using the naming convention appropriate for your language of choice.
Write a program that accepts an input of an integer and prints whether the number is a palindrome or not.


## Testing
