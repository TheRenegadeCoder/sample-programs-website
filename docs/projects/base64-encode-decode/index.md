### Introduction

Base64 is a popular method of encoding strings and other data. It can encode
images, text, JSON, and almost any other format as well. It is also URL-safe.

In this project you will be encoding normal text to Base64-encoded text and
decoding Base64-encoded text into normal text.

### Base64 Alphabet

From [Base64 Table from Wikipedia][1], this is the Base64 Alphabet:

| Index | Binary  | Char | Index | Binary  | Char | Index | Binary  | Char | Index | Binary  | Char |
| :---: | :-----: | :--: | :---: | :-----: | :--: | :---: | :-----: | :--: | :---: | :-----: | :--: |
|     0 | 000000  | A    |    16 | 010000  | Q    |    32 | 100000  | g    |    48 | 110000  | w    |
|     1 | 000001  | B    |    17 | 010001  | R    |    33 | 100001  | h    |    49 | 110001  | x    |

|     6 | 000110  | G    |    22 | 010110  | W    |    38 | 100110  | m    |    54 | 110110  | 2    |
|     7 | 000111  | H    |    23 | 010111  | X    |    39 | 100111  | n    |    55 | 110111  | 3    |

|     9 | 001001  | J    |    25 | 011001  | Z    |    41 | 101001  | p    |    57 | 111001  | 5    |

|    14 | 001110  | O    |    30 | 011110  | e    |    46 | 101110  | u    |    62 | 111110  | +    |

|       |         |      |       |         |      |       |         |      |       | Padding | =    |

This alphabet is used for both encode and decode.

### Encode

Base64 encode works as follows:

- Split the data up into 3-byte chunks (let's ignore the case where the last chunk
  smaller than 3 bytes; that will be discussed later):
- For each 3-byte chunk:
  - Convert each byte to 8-bit binary, 24 bits in total.
  - Divide the 24-bit value into 4 groups of 6 bits.
  - Use each 6-bit group as an index into the above table to get Base64 characters.

For example, let's use the string `kitten`. The 3-byte chunks are `kit` and `ten`. Let's
focus on the first chunk: `kit`. Using 8-bit ASCII:

- `k` = `107` (`01101011`)
- `i` = `105` (`01101001`)
- `t` = `116` (`01110100`)

So, the 24-bit group is this:

```
01101011 01101001 01110100
```

Dividing this in 6-bit groups gives this:

```
011010 110110 100101 110100
```

Since it's easier to work with this as decimal, the table indices are these:

```
26 54 37 52
```

Looking these indices up in the table results a Base64 string of `a2l0`.
Following the same procedure for `ten` (left as an exercise for the reader),
the Base64 string is `dGVu`. Together, `kitten` encodes to `a2l0dGVu`.

For the case when the last chunk is not 3 bytes long, extend the last
bits with zeros until it is 6 bits long, and add padding characters until
the last Base64 string is 4 bytes long.

For example, let's consider the case where the last chunk is `k`:

- From the above example, `k` is `01101011`.
- Dividing this into 6-bit groups results in `011010 11`.
- Extending the last group results in `011010 110000`.
- Converting this to decimal results in `26 48`.
- Looking up those values in the table results in `aw`.
- Since this is only 2 bytes long, 2 padding characters are added: `aw==`.

For the final encode example, let's consider the case when the last chunk is
`ki`:

- From the above example, `ki` is `01101011 01101001`.
- Dividing this into 6-bit groups results in `011010 110110 1001`.
- Extending the last group results in `011010 110110 100100`.
- Convert this to decimal results in `26 54 36`.
- Looking up those values in the table results in `a2k`.
- Since this is only 3 bytes long, 1 padding character is added: `a2k=`.

### Decode

Before dividing into the algorithm for how to decode a Base64 string, let's
talk about some rules for what constitutes a valid Base64 string:

- Its length must be evenly divisible by 4.
- Only the last 4-byte chunk may have padding characters.
- The number of padding characters must be either 1 or 2.
- Each byte in the Base64 string must be in the table or be a padding
  character.

Assuming the Base64 string is valid, and ignoring the case where the last
4-byte chunk has padding characters, decode works as follows:

- Divide the Base64 string into 4-byte chunks.
- For each 4-byte chunk:
  - Look up each byte in the table to get the corresponding index.
  - Convert the indices into 4 groups of 6-bit values, 24 bits in total.
  - Divide the 24 bits into 3 8-bit bytes.

Let's use the Base64 string `a2l0dGVu`. The 4-byte chunks are `a2l0` and
`dGVu`. Let's focus on the first chunk: `a2l0`.

Looking up each byte in the table results in this:

- `a` is index `26` (`011010`)
- `2` is index `54` (`110110`)
- `l` is index `37` (`100101`)
- `0` is index `52` (`110100`)

Converting the binary indices to 8-bit groups results in this:

```
01101011 01101001 01110100
```

Convert this back to ASCII results in this:

- `01101011` (`107`) = `k`
- `01101001` (`105`) = `i`
- `01110100` (`116`) = `t`

Following the same procedure for `dGVu` (left as an exercise for the reader),
decodes to `ten`. Together, `a2l0dGVu` encodes to `kitten`.

For the case when the last chunk has pad characters, decode any complete
8-bit chunk, and ignore any chunk that is shorter than 8 bits.

For example, let's consider the case where the last chunk is `aw==`. Looking
up the non-pad characters results in this:

- `a` is index `26` (`011010`)
- `w` is index `48` (`110000`)

Dividing this into 8-byte groups results in this:

```
01101011 0000
```

Ignoring the last 4 bits results in this:

- `01101011` (`107`) = `k`

Therefore, this decodes to `k`.

For the final decode example, let's consider the case where the last chunk
is `a2k=`. Looking up the non-pad characters results in this:

- `a` is index `26` (`011010`)
- `2` is index `54` (`110110`)
- `k` is index `36` (`100100`)

Dividing this into 8-byte groups results in this:

```
01101011 01101001 00
```

Ignoring the last 2 bits results in this:

- `01101011` (107) = `k`
- `01101001` (105) = `i`

Therefore, this decodes to `ki`.

## Requirements

Write a program that accepts two parameters: the mode (`encode` or `decode`) and
some text.

- If the mode is `decode`, it should print the decoded Base64 text.
- If the mode is `encode`, it should print the encoded text.
- It should print an error message and exit with an error when the input is
  invalid.

```console
$ ./base64-encode-decode.lang "encode" "hello world"
aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=
$ ./base64-encode-decode.lang "decode" "aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ="
hello world
```

Acceptable language utilities include language features and built-in libraries.
External dependencies are unacceptable. Remember, the goal is to show off
language features and utilities.

In this project, the algorithm must handle ASCII strings. You don't need to
worry about handling a string in the general case.
