Welcome to the [Prime Number](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/prime-number) in [Kotlin](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/kotlin) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) 
{
    if (args.isNullOrEmpty() || args[0].isBlank() || args[0].toIntOrNull()?.takeIf { it >= 0 } == null) {
        println("Usage: please input a non-negative integer")
        return
    }

    val num = args[0].toInt()
    if(num>1)
    {
        for(i in 2 until num)
        {
            if(num%i == 0)
            {
                println("Composite")
                return
            }
        }
        println("Prime")
    }
    else
    {
        println("Composite")
    }
}
```
