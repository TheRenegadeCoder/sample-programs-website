Welcome to the Prime Number page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

A prime number is a positive integer which is divisible only by 1 and itself.
For example: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13

Since every number is divisible by One so, Two is the only even and the
smallest prime number.


## Requirements

Create a file called Prime Number using the naming
convention appropriate for your language of choice.

Write a sample program which accepts an integer on the command line
and outputs if the integer is a Prime number or not.


## Testing

Every project in the Sample Programs repo should be tested. In this section, we specify the set of tests specific to Prime Number. To keep things simple, we split up testing into two subsets: valid and invalid. Valid tests refer to tests that occur under correct input conditions. Invalid tests refer to tests that occur on bad input (e.g., letters instead of numbers).

### Valid Tests

No 'Valid Tests' section available. [Please consider contributing](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs-website).

### Invalid Tests

No 'Invalid Tests' section available. [Please consider contributing](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs-website).
