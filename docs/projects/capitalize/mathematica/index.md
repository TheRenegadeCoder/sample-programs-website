Welcome to the [Capitalize](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/capitalize) in [Mathematica](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/mathematica) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```mathematica
(* Code *)

(* The actual capitalization operating on Mathematica strings: *)

capitalize = StringReplace[
   StartOfString ~~ l : LetterCharacter  -> ToUpperCase[l]];

(* The outer function provides the 'user interface': *)

capitalizeMain = s \[Function]
   Catch[
    capitalize[
     If[
      StringQ[s] \[And] \[Not] StringMatchQ[s, ""],
      s,
      Throw["Usage: please provide a string"]]]];


(* Valid Tests *)
Print /@ capitalizeMain /@ {
    "hello",
    "Hello",
    "hello world",
    "heLLo World",
    "12345"
    };


(* Invalid Tests *)
capitalizeMain[""]
```

{% endraw %}
