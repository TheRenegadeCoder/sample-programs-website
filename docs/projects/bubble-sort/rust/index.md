Welcome to the [Bubble Sort](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/bubble-sort) in [Rust](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/rust) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```rust
use std::env;

fn bubble_sort(arr: &mut Vec<i32>) {
  let mut swap_occured = true;

  while swap_occured {
    swap_occured = false;

    for i in 1..arr.len() {
      if arr[i - 1] > arr[i] {
        arr.swap(i - 1, i);
        swap_occured = true;
      }
    }
  }
}

fn main() {
  let err_msg = "Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\"";
  let args: Vec<String> = env::args().collect();

  if args.len() < 2 {
    panic!(err_msg);
  }

  let mut arr: Vec<i32> = args[1].clone()
    .split(",")
    .map(|s| s.trim().parse().expect(err_msg))
    .collect();

  if arr.len() < 2 {
    panic!(err_msg);
  }

  bubble_sort(&mut arr);
  println!("{:?}", arr);
}
```

{% endraw %}
