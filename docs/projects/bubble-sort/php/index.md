Welcome to the [Bubble Sort](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/bubble-sort) in [Php](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/php) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```php
<?php

if (empty($argv[1])) {
    exit('Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"');
}

$numbers = array_map('intval', explode(',', $argv[1]));
$array_size = count($numbers);

if ($array_size <= 1) {
    exit('Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"');
}

for ($i = 0; $i < $array_size; $i++) {
    for ($j = 0; $j < $array_size; $j++) {
        if ($numbers[$i] < $numbers[$j]) {
            $temp = $numbers[$i];
            $numbers[$i] = $numbers[$j];
            $numbers[$j] = $temp;
        }
    }
}

echo implode(', ', $numbers);
```
