Welcome to the Quine page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

For those of you that don't know, a quine is a program which can replicate
itself--or more specifically:

> A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a
> copy of its own source code as its only output.

Thanks, [Wikipedia][1]!


## Requirements

For the purposes of this repo, the solution should be simple. We're not here
to play code golf, but we're also not here to practice obfuscation. Just be
reasonable with your solution.


## Testing

Verify that the actual output matches the expected output. See the
[requirements][2] section for an example of the expected output.
