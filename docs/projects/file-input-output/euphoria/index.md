Welcome to the [File Input Output](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/file-input-output) in [Euphoria](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/euphoria) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```euphoria
include std/io.e
include std/types.e

function write_file(sequence filename)
    integer fn = open(filename, "w")
    if fn < 0
    then
        printf(STDERR, "Cannot open %s for write\n", {filename})
        return FALSE
    end if

    puts(fn, "Hello from Euphoria!\n")
    puts(fn, "This is a line\n")
    puts(fn, "This is another line\n")
    puts(fn, "Goodbye!\n")
    close(fn)
    return TRUE
end function

function read_file(sequence filename)
    integer fn = open(filename, "r")
    if fn < 0
        then
        printf(STDERR, "Cannot open %s for read\n", {filename})
        return FALSE
    end if

    object line
    while 1
    do
        line = gets(fn)
        if atom(line)
        then
            exit
        end if

        puts(STDOUT, line)
    end while

    close(fn)
    return TRUE
end function

constant filename = "output.txt"
if write_file(filename)
then
    read_file(filename)
end if
```

{% endraw %}
