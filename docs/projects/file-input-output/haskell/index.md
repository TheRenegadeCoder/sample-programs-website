Welcome to the [File Input Output](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/file-input-output) in [Haskell](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/haskell) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```haskell
module Main where

import System.IO

main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- write
  handle <- openFile "output.txt" ReadWriteMode
  hPutStr handle "file contents"
  hClose handle
  -- read
  handle <- openFile "output.txt" ReadWriteMode
  value <- hGetContents handle
  -- Print the contents of the file that was read.
  -- Haskell reads the file lazily, so the value must be printed before the handle is closed
  putStrLn value
  hClose handle
```

{% endraw %}
