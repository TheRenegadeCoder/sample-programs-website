Welcome to the [Insertion Sort](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/insertion-sort) in [Php](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/php) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```php
<?php

function insertion_Sort($my_array)
{
    for ($i = 0; $i < count($my_array); $i++) {
        $val = $my_array[$i];
        $j = $i - 1;
        while ($j >= 0 && $my_array[$j] > $val) {
            $my_array[$j + 1] = $my_array[$j];
            $j--;
        }
        $my_array[$j + 1] = $val;
    }
    return $my_array;
}

if (empty($argv[1])) {
    exit('Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"');
}

$test_array = array_map('intval', explode(',', $argv[1]));
$array_size = count($test_array);

if ($array_size <= 1) {
    exit('Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"');
}

$out = insertion_Sort($test_array);
echo implode(', ', $out);
```

{% endraw %}
