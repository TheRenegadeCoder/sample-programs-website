Welcome to the [Merge Sort](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/merge-sort) in [Php](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/php) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```php
<?php
function merge_sort($my_array)
{
    if (count($my_array) == 1) {
        return $my_array;
    }

    $mid = count($my_array) / 2;
    $left = array_slice($my_array, 0, $mid);
    $right = array_slice($my_array, $mid);
    $left = merge_sort($left);
    $right = merge_sort($right);
    return merge($left, $right);
}
function merge($left, $right)
{
    $res = array();
    while (count($left) > 0 && count($right) > 0) {
        if ($left[0] > $right[0]) {
            $res[] = $right[0];
            $right = array_slice($right, 1);
        } else {
            $res[] = $left[0];
            $left = array_slice($left, 1);
        }
    }
    while (count($left) > 0) {
        $res[] = $left[0];
        $left = array_slice($left, 1);
    }
    while (count($right) > 0) {
        $res[] = $right[0];
        $right = array_slice($right, 1);
    }
    return $res;
}

if (empty($argv[1])) {
    exit('Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"');
}

$test_array = array_map('intval', explode(',', $argv[1]));
$array_size = count($test_array);

if ($array_size <= 1) {
    exit('Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format "1, 2, 3, 4, 5"');
}

echo implode(', ', merge_sort($test_array)) . "\n";
```

{% endraw %}
