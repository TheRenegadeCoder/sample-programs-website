Welcome to the [Rot13](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/rot13) in [Mathematica](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/mathematica) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```mathematica
(* Code *)

(* The actual rotation operating on Mathematica strings: *)

rot13 = s \[Function] StringJoin @@ Function[{c},
      FromCharacterCode @
       Piecewise[(* operate piecewise on the domain of ASCII character codes *)
        Append[{
            Mod[c + 13, 26, First@ToCharacterCode[StringTake[#, 1]]],
            Between[c, ToCharacterCode[#]]} & /@
          {"az", "AZ"},(* specific character intervals to operate on *)
         {c, True}] (* default does nothing *)
        ]] /@ ToCharacterCode[s];

(* The outer function provides the 'user interface': *)

rot13Main = s \[Function]
   Catch[
    rot13[
     If[
      StringQ[s] \[And] \[Not] StringMatchQ[s, ""],
      s,
      Throw["Usage: please provide a string to encrypt"]]]];


(* Valid Tests *)

Print /@ rot13Main /@ {
    "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog",
    "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG",
    "The quick brown fox jumped. Was it over the lazy dog?"
    };


(* Invalid Tests *)

rot13Main[""]
```

{% endraw %}
