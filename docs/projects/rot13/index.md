Welcome to the Rot13 page! Here, you'll find a description of the project as well as a list of sample programs written in various languages.

## Description

ROT13 is a letter substitution cipher where every letter is replaced by the
letter 13 letters after it alphabetically and wrapping from `Z` to `A` if necessary:

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ -> NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM

As a result, encrypted strings can be decrypted using the same algorithm:

    NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM -> ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ


## Requirements

Write a sample program that takes a string of text as input.
It should then encrypt the inputted text using ROT13 and output the result to the console.

```console
$ ./rot13.lang "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcrq bire gur ynml qbt
```

The solution should handle both lower case and capital letters

```console
$ ./rot13.lang "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG"
GUR DHVPX OEBJA SBK WHZCRQ BIRE GUR YNML QBT
```

Any characters/symbols besides a-z and A-Z should be ignored.

```console
$ ./rot13.lang "The quick brown fox jumped. Was it over the lazy dog?"
Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcrq. Jnf vg bire gur ynml qbt?
```

In addition, there should be some error handling for situations where the user
doesn't supply any input.


## Testing

Every project in the [Sample Programs repo](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs) should be tested.
In this section, we specify the set of tests specific to Rot13.
In order to keep things simple, we split up the testing as follows:

- Rot13 Valid Tests
- Rot13 Invalid Tests

### Rot13 Valid Tests

| Description | Input | Output |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| Sample Input Lower Case | "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" | "gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcrq bire gur ynml qbt" |
| Sample Input Upper Case | "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPED OVER THE LAZY DOG" | "GUR DHVPX OEBJA SBK WHZCRQ BIRE GUR YNML QBT" |
| Sample Input Punctuation | "The quick brown fox jumped. Was it over the lazy dog?" | "Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcrq. Jnf vg bire gur ynml qbt?" |

### Rot13 Invalid Tests

| Description | Input |
| ----------- | ----- |
| No Input |  |
| Empty Input | "" |

All of these tests should output the following:

```
Usage: please provide a string to encrypt
```
