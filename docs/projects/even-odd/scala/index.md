Welcome to the [Even Odd](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/even-odd) in [Scala](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/scala) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```scala
// Scala Program to check if input number is Odd or Even
object evenodd 
{ 

	def check_even_odd(n: Int): Int = { 
		result = if (num%2==0) "Even" else "Odd"
    return result
	} 

	// Driver Code 
	def main(args: Array[String]) 
	{   val m= args(0).toInt
		println(evenodd(m)) 
	} 

}
```

{% endraw %}
