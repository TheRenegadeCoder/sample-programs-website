// Scala Program to check if input number is Odd or Even
object evenodd 
{ 

    def check_even_odd(n: Int): Int = { 
        result = if (num%2==0) "Even" else "Odd"
    return result
    } 

    // Driver Code 
    def main(args: Array[String]) 
    {   val m= args(0).toInt
        println(evenodd(m)) 
    } 

}
```
