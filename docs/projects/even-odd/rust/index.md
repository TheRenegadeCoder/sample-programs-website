Welcome to the [Even Odd](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/even-odd) in [Rust](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/rust) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```rust
// Requirement is in https://sample-programs.therenegadecoder.com/projects/even-odd/
// Program to accept an integer on the command line and outputs if the integer is Even or Odd.

use std::env::args;
use std::process::exit;
use std::num::ParseIntError;

fn usage() -> ! {
    println!("Usage: please input a number");
    exit(0);
}

fn parse_int(s: String) -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> {
    s.trim().parse::<i32>()
}

fn main() {
    // Exit if 1st command-line argument not an integer
    let mut input_num: i32 = parse_int(
        args().nth(1).unwrap_or_else(|| usage())
    ).unwrap_or_else(|_| usage());

    // Even if divisible by 2, Odd otherwise
    match input_num % 2 == 0 {
        true => println!("Even"),
        false => println!("Odd"),
    }
}
```

{% endraw %}
