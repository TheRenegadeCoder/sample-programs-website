Welcome to the [Even Odd](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/even-odd) in [Swift](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/swift) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```swift
// for System.exit()
import Foundation


/*
    Check if there is exactly one argument and if it can be parsed as an integer
*/
guard CommandLine.argc == 2, let number = Int(CommandLine.arguments[1]) else {
    print("Usage: please input a number")
    exit(0)
}

let is_even = number % 2 == 0

if is_even {
    print("Even")
} else {
    print("Odd")
