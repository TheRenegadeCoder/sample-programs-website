Welcome to the [Even Odd](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/even-odd) in [Haskell](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/haskell) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```haskell
module Main where

import System.Environment
import Text.Read

data EvenOdd = Even | Odd deriving (Show)

isEvenOdd :: Int -> EvenOdd
isEvenOdd x
  | x `mod` 2 == 0 = Even
  | otherwise  = Odd

headMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe a
headMaybe []     = Nothing
headMaybe (x:xs) = Just x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  args <- getArgs
  let x = headMaybe args
  case x >>= readMaybe of
    Nothing -> putStrLn "Usage: please input a number"
    Just x  -> putStrLn $ show $ isEvenOdd x
```

{% endraw %}
