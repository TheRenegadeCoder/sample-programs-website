Welcome to the [Even Odd](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/even-odd) in [Go](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/go) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
)

func exitWithError() {
	fmt.Println("Usage: please input a number")
	os.Exit(1)
}

func main() {
	if len(os.Args) != 2 {
		exitWithError()
	}

	n, err := strconv.Atoi(os.Args[1])
	if err != nil {
		exitWithError()
	}

	if n%2 == 0 {
		fmt.Printf("Even\n")
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("Odd\n")
	}
