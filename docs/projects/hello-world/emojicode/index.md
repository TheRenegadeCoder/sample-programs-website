Welcome to the [Hello World](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/hello-world) in [Emojicode](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/emojicode) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```emojicode
🏁 🍇
  😀 🔤Hello, World!🔤❗️
🍉
```

{% endraw %}

**Note**: The solution shown above is the current solution in the Sample Programs repository as of May 13 2023 21:01:35. The solution was first committed on May 05 2018 17:08:17. As a result, documentation below may be outdated.

## How to Implement the Solution

Let's take a look at the Hello World sample.

From there we will break down the rest. 

First `🏁` is symbolic of the starting flag in a race, and it represents that following it there will be a code block. Also when running it will run the code block that follows the Flag emoji.

Next, code blocks are denoted by starting with a `🍇`, followed by the code, and ending with a `🍉`.

One of the most important emojis is `😀` and this smiling emoji is passed a string and it outputs the string to standard output (in this case the string is `Hello, World!`). It must be terminated with `❗️`.

Finally, the `🔤` emoji is used similarly to `"s` or `'s` in other languages as it holds a string within a pair of them.


## How to Run the Solution

There is no better spot to learn how to run the Hello World program in Emojicode than directly from [Emojicode Official Docs][1]
