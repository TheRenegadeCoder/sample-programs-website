## How to Implement the Solution

This is quite possibly the smallest Hello World out there and it just so happens to be identical to Hello World in javascript (the language TypeScript is built on). 

Simply put it logs the phrase `Hello, World!` to the console in your browser.


## How to Run the Solution


Quite possibly the easiest way to run this is to open developer tools in your browser of choice, however, do note that the following is based on Chrome. This is often done by the shortcut "CRTL-SHIFT-I". Clicking on console at the top of the screen. Where the arrow is at the bottom of the console output is a text entry box and in there type the code from above(`console.log("Hello, World!");`). Finally, press enter and see `Hello, World!` in the Console output.
