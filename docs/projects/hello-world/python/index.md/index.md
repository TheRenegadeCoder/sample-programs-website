Welcome to the Hello World in Python page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

Note: The solution shown here is the current solution in the Sample Programs repository. Documentation below may be outdated.

```Python
print('Hello, World!')

```

## How to Implement the Solution

I chose Python to start as it has probably the easiest and most readable 
Hello World implementation in the realm of programming languages:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
And, we’re done. In fact, we don’t even have to compile anything. If we’re in 
the interpreter, we’ll print right away. Otherwise, we can easily call the 
script from the command line to get our result.

As you can probably imagine, this code works because Python has a built-in 
function called *print*. By passing that function a string, the interpreter 
is able to call the Python libraries that make the print possible.


## How to Run the Solution

If we want to run this program, we should probably download a copy of 
Hello World in Python. After that, we should make sure we have the 
[latest Python interpreter][1]. From there, we can simply run the following 
command in the terminal:

```console
python hello-world.py
```

Alternatively, we can copy the solution into an [online Python interpreter][2] 
and hit run.
