Welcome to the [Hello World](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/hello-world) in [Rexx](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/rexx) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```rexx
say "Hello, World!"

```

{% endraw %}

## How to Implement the Solution

To print 'Hello World!' in Rexx, we need to take note of two points:

- the program starts with a comment line to identify it as a REXX program. Hence, comments are added between `/* */`.
- use `SAY` command before the desired output or value

So, let's get to the point and see how to implement the solution:

```rexx
/* Print 'Hello-World!' sample program in REXX */
SAY 'Hello World!'
```

And that's it! It is a very simple one-liner program with a few specifications. The comments tell us what the program does and the intruction 'say' is used to print the program 'Hello World!'.

`SAY` is a basic command to print output on the same lines as `PRINT` from Python. It remains constant regardless of the version.


## How to Run the Solution

In order to run this program, you can install REXX through [online sources](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rexx/rexx_installation.htm) and run it. Alternatively, you can directly run it on [online interpreters](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_rexx_online.php).
