Welcome to the [Hello World](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/hello-world) in [Hack](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/hack) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```hack
<?hh
echo "Hello, World!";
```

{% endraw %}

## How to Implement the Solution

At long last, let's take a stab at Hello World in Hack.

Right away, you should scream "that looks a lot like PHP!" 
After all, Hack is just a dialect of PHP.

That said, there is at least one obvious syntactic difference: 
the Hack tag. I can't seem to figure out the formal name of 
the `<?hh` tag, so I've been calling it the Hack tag. At any 
rate, at least that's different.

Beyond the tag, Hello World in Hack is exactly the same in Hello 
World in PHP. However, I will point out that you can't mix HTML 
with Hack like you can with PHP, so that's probably the biggest 
syntactic difference. Otherwise, both languages perform a similar 
function: backend web development.


## How to Run the Solution

If we want to try this code, we can use an [online Hack compiler][1].

Alternatively, we can download the Hack Virtual Machine to run
Hack code locally. From there, I recommend reading up on how to
get started with Hack. Getting everything up and running is bit
out of scope of this article.
