## How to Implement the Solution

Syntax in [Octave][1] is based on its Octave scripting language.

One line is all it takes! The "details-hidden" nature of the languages removes
the need to declare variables or classes before the fun begins. `disp` is the
command in Octave that formats data and displays it in the command window. In
this case, the data is the string "Hello, World!" (denoted by the
quotations).

## How to Run the Solution

If you want to try this out yourself:

- Visit the [Octave Download page][2], and download the version for your Operating System (OS).
- Follow the installation instructions for your OS.
- Download the [program sample file][3].

Run the script like this:

```
octave -qf hello-world.m
```

Alternatively, you can use [Octave Online][4]. Just copy/paste the script into the input
command prompt and press Enter.
