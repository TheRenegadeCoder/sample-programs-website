Welcome to the Hello World in D page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

Note: The solution shown here is the current solution in the Sample Programs repository. Documentation below may be outdated.

```D
import std.stdio;

void main()
{
	writeln("Hello, World!");
}

```

## How to Implement the Solution

At any rate, let’s get to the implementation of Hello World in D:

```d
import std.stdio;
void main()
{
    writeln("Hello, World!");
}
```

At this point, you may be questioning whether or not D is even a new 
language. After all, this Hello World implementation looks a lot like 
C/C++.

Well, then it should come as no surprise the solution is pretty much 
the same. We have basically three main parts: the import statement, 
the main function, and the print function.

Just like C/C++, the first thing we do is import our standard output 
library. In this case, D references std.stdio as opposed to stdio.h 
in C.

Up next, we have our usual main function. At this point in the series, 
we’re pretty use to this syntax.

Finally, we have our typical print function. In this case, we call 
writeln and pass a string to it.


## How to Run the Solution

If we wanted to run our code snippet from above, we can leverage an 
online D compiler.

Alternatively, we can download our own D compiler from the official 
website. Then, we’ll want to get a copy of Hello World in D. After 
that, we can simply run the following:

```shell
rdmd hello-world.d
```

And, that’s it! The string “Hello, World!” should appear in the console.
