Welcome to the Hello World in Tex page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

Note: The solution shown here is the current solution in the Sample Programs repository. Documentation below may be outdated.

```Tex
%&pdftex

Hello, World!
\end

```

## How to Implement the Solution

At any rate, let's dive right into Hello World in Tex:

```tex
%&pdftex

Hello, World!
\end
```
It is much simpler in Tex due to the fact the Tex is a markup language.

```tex
%&pdftex
```
This first line is a declaring line used to explain that the desired output of this tex file is a pdf.

```tex
Hello, World!
```
This is the body better known as what will be displayed. You could replace that text with anything to have it show up.

```tex
\end
```
Finally, this is saying the document has ended by declaring(`\`) an `end`.


## How to Run the Solution

There are many options for running Tex files both online and offline. This said my personal favorite option is running it online through [Overleaf][1]. They even cover the other options including themselves on their website [here][2].
