Welcome to the [Hello World](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/hello-world) in [Tex](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/tex) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```tex
\newwrite\out
\immediate\openout\out=hello-world.txt
\immediate\write\out{Hello, World!}
\end

```

## How to Implement the Solution

Let's dive right into Hello World in Tex.

It is much simpler in Tex due to the fact the Tex is a markup language.

```tex
\newwrite\out
\immediate\openout\out=hello-world.txt
```

This first two lines create an output file called `hello-world.txt`.

```tex
\immediate\write\out{Hello, World!}
```

This writes `Hello, World!` to the output file.

```tex
\end
```

Finally, this is saying the document has ended by declaring (`\`) an `end`.


## How to Run the Solution

There are many options for running Tex files both online and offline. This said my personal favorite option is running it online through [Overleaf][1]. Here is what you will need to do:

1. You will need to create an account (if you do not already have one).
2. Click on the `Project` button.
3. Select `Create New Project`, and select `Blank Project`.
4. Call the project `Hello World`, and click the `Create` button.
5. Select all the code in the `Code Editor` field, and delete it.
6. Copy the [Hello World in Tex][3] sample and paste it into the `Code Editor` field.
7. Click the `Recompile` button.
8. Since this sample does not generate a PDF file, you will have to scroll down to the bottom, click
   on the `Other Files` button, and select `hello-world.txt`. This will download the file to your
   computer. If you open that file, you will see `Hello, World!`.

[Overleaf][1] even covers the other options including themselves on their website [here][2].
