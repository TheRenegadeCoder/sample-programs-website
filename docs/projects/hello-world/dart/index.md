Welcome to the [Hello World](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/hello-world) in [Dart](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/dart) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```dart
void main() => print('Hello, World!');

```

{% endraw %}

## How to Implement the Solution

Coming from a Java background, the following snippet of code is downright
stripped to the barebones.

In order to implement Hello World in Dart, developers need to understand only
three concepts like `main` methods, strings, and arrow functions. But look at the
code above, it seems deceptively easy, right?

What is going on is `main()` only does one thing, print the phrase "Hello, World!".
We'll dig into how and why all of this happens in a bit, but it's important to
step away for a bit and just look at what's there and acknowledge how simple it is.

In a Dart project, only one class would have a main method (`main()`). A `main`
method is how every Dart program knows where to start. Therefore, every program
must have exactly one of these `main` methods implemented. Don't worry too much
about the syntax. Just know that we need a `main` method.

Then we have to output our greeting ("Hello, World!") to the command line. To
do so, we have to leverage a static method out of Dart's built-in library. It's
the `print` statement. It's a method like `main()` only difference is we put a
string inside the parentheses. It tells the computer to take the string and
print out so we can read it.

The last concept are arrow functions (`=>`). These are methods like `print` or,
in this case, `main` that only do one thing. Because they only do one thing, we
can use `=>` from the method's definition (`main()`) directly to the logic.
Other more complex methods may require the use of `return`. But that's not
required in this case.


## How to Run the Solution

To run this program, just download the [Dart interpreter][1]. Then, run this:

```
dart hello-world.dart
```

Alternatively, you can use an [online Dart interpreter][2].
