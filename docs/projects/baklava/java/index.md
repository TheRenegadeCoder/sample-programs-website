Welcome to the [Baklava](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/baklava) in [Java](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/java) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```java
public class Baklava {
    public static void up() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            printRow(i);
    }

    public static void down() {
        for (int i = 10; i >= 0; i--)
            printRow(i);
    }

    public static void printRow(int rowNum) {
        for (int j = 10 - rowNum; j > 0; j--)
            System.out.print(" ");
        for (int j = 0; j <= rowNum * 2; j++)
            System.out.print("*");
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        up();
        down();
    }
}
```

{% endraw %}
