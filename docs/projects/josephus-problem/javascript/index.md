Welcome to the [Josephus Problem](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/josephus-problem) in [Javascript](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/javascript) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```javascript
const josephus = (n, k) => {
    if (n == 1) return 1;
    else return ((josephus(n - 1, k) + k - 1) % n) + 1;
};

const usage =
    "Usage: please input the total number of people and number of people to skip.";

const n = parseInt(process.argv[2]);
const k = parseInt(process.argv[3]);

if (!n || !k || typeof n !== "number" || typeof k !== "number") {
    return console.log(usage);
}

console.log(josephus(n, k));
```

{% endraw %}
