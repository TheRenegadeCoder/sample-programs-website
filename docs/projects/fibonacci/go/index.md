Welcome to the [Fibonacci](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/fibonacci) in [Go](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/go) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "strconv"
)

func fibonacci(n int, c chan int) {
    x, y := 1, 1
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        c <- x
        x, y = y, x+y
    }
    close(c)
}

func exitWithError() {
    fmt.Println("Usage: please input the count of fibonacci numbers to output")
    os.Exit(1)
}

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) != 2 {
        exitWithError()
    }

    n, err := strconv.Atoi(os.Args[1])
    if err != nil {
        exitWithError()
    }

    c := make(chan int, n)

    go fibonacci(cap(c), c)
    i := 1
    for v := range c {
        fmt.Printf("%d: %d\n", i, v)
        i++
    }
}
```

{% endraw %}
