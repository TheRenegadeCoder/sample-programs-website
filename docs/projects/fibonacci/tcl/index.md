Welcome to the [Fibonacci](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/fibonacci) in [Tcl](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/tcl) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```tcl
proc usage {} {
    puts "Usage: please input the count of fibonacci numbers to output"
    exit 1
}

if {$argc != 1} { usage }

set count [lindex $argv 0]

if {![string is integer -strict $count] || $count < 0} { usage }

set a 1
set b 1

for {set i 1} {$i <= $count} {incr i} {
    puts "$i: $a"

    set next [expr {$a + $b}]
    set a $b
    set b $next
}

```
