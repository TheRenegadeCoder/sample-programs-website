Welcome to the [Fibonacci](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/fibonacci) in [Racket](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/racket) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```racket
#lang racket

;; A naive iimplementation of fibonacci

(define (fib n)
  (cond
    [(<= n 2)  1]
    [else
     (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))]))
     

  
(define (fibonacci n)
  (cond
    [(or (not n) (< n 0)) (display "Usage: please input the count of fibonacci numbers to output")]
    
    [else
     (for ([i (in-range 1 (add1 n))]) 
       (displayln (string-append (number->string i) ": " (number->string (fib i)))))
     ]))
    
  
(fibonacci 
  (string->number 
    (cond
      [(vector-empty? (current-command-line-arguments)) ""] 
      [else (vector-ref (current-command-line-arguments) 0)]
    )
  )
)
```

{% endraw %}
