Welcome to the [Fibonacci](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/fibonacci) in [C++](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/c-plus-plus) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    if (argc < 2 || std::string(argv[1]) == "")
    {
        cout << "Usage: please input the count of fibonacci numbers to output" << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    int n = atoi(argv[1]);
    if (n == 0 && std::string(argv[1]) != "0")
    {
        cout << "Usage: please input the count of fibonacci numbers to output" << endl;
        return 1;
    }
    int first = 0;
    int second = 1;
    int result = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    {
        result = first + second;
        first = second;
        second = result;
        cout << i << ": " << first << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

{% endraw %}
