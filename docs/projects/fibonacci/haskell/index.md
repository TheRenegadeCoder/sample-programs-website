Welcome to the [Fibonacci](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/fibonacci) in [Haskell](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/haskell) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```haskell
module Main where

import System.Environment
import Text.Read

fibonacci :: Int -> [Integer]
fibonacci = flip (take) fibs

fibs :: [Integer]
fibs = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

headMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe a
headMaybe []     = Nothing
headMaybe (x:xs) = Just x

-- Takes a list of values and returns a list of strings in the format "ONE_BASED_INDEX: VALUE"
printWithIndex :: (Show a) => [a] -> [[Char]]
printWithIndex = zipWith (\i x -> (show i) ++ ": " ++ (show x)) [1..]


-- Prints out the first N numbers from the fibonacci sequence
-- where N equals to the first command line argument.
main :: IO ()
main = do
  args <- getArgs
  let n = headMaybe args
  case n >>= readMaybe of
    Nothing -> putStrLn "Usage: please input the count of fibonacci numbers to output"
    Just n  -> mapM_ (putStrLn) $ (printWithIndex . fibonacci) n
```

{% endraw %}
