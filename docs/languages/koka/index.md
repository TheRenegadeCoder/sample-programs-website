Welcome to the Koka page! Here, you'll find a description of the language as well as a list of sample programs in that language.

## Description

Koka is a function-oriented programming language created by Microsoft researcher
[Daan Leijen][1]. Leijan created Koka to separate pure values from side-effecting
computations. According to [Wikipedia][2], a function or expression is said to have a
side effect if it modifies some state outside of its local environment.

In addition, Koka has many features that help programmers easily change their data
types and code organization correctly while having a small language core with a
familiar JavaScript-like syntax.

Fun Fact: the word 'Koka' (or 効果) means "effect" or "effective" in Japanese.
