Welcome to the Crystal page! Here, you'll find a description of the language as well as a list of sample programs in that language.

## Description

Like Julia, Crystal is another open-source language with a nice Wikipedia 
page, so we’ll be using that to get some language background.

According to Wikipedia, Crystal is a general-purpose language that first 
appeared in 2014. As of today, Crystal is self-hosted meaning the compiler 
is written in an earlier version of Crystal.

That said, Crystal was inspired by Ruby which is the language Crystal was 
originally written in. However, as previously mentioned, Crystal is a compiled 
language, so many of the dynamic features of Ruby no longer exist.

Despite the lack of dynamic features, Crystal leverages strong type inference 
to allow for implicit typing. As a result, the language looks like a high-level 
scripting language. However, the language’s efficiency is much closer to 
lower-level languages like C.
