## Description

According to [Wikipedia][1], Ruby is a general-purpose language that first appeared back in 1995 in Japan. 
Apparently, Ruby is a truly object-oriented language in the sense that almost everything is an object. 
In fact, even numbers are objects in Ruby which means they can be subjected to the dot operator. How cool is that?

Today, the other major industry languages like [Python][2] and [Java][3] are more popular general-purpose languages, 
so Ruby often finds its place as a web development language. This is probably due to the Ruby on Rails 
framework which helps developers build web applications quickly and easily.
  
## Features
  
- Everything is an object
- Closures
- Mixins
