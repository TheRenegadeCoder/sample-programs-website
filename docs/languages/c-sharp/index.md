Welcome to the C# page! Here, you'll find a description of the language as well as a list of sample programs in that language.

## Description

As always, I took to [Wikipedia][1] to learn more about C#.

Just like our other programming languages so far, C# is a general-purpose
language. However, unlike our other languages, C# was designed for the Microsoft
platform as a part of the [.NET][2] initiative in 2000. We'll see something along the
same lines when we get to languages like Objective-C and Swift.

Some notable features of C# include the virtual and var keywords as well as
properties and namespaces. Because of these features, C# can seem like a nice
cross between [Java][3] and [C++][4]. In fact, C# is often considered a clone of Java.

Personally, I like C# much more than Java. I won't go into too much of a
tangent, but C# has this beautiful feature that allows us to declare getters and
setters in a single line. Just take a look:

```csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
```

Now, we have a string which we can get and set directly and safely without
having to implement our own methods. **I love this syntax**.

Also, I love the fact that C# can be used to develop games in Unity. Beyond
Android apps, I haven't seen many fun commercial uses for Java.
