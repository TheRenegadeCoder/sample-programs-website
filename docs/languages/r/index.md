Welcome to the R page! Here, you'll find a description of the language as well as a list of sample programs in that language.

## Description

R is a language as well as an environment especially suited for statistical
computing, data analysis and data visualization. The first version of this
GNU project was [released in 1995][5]. The last major version 3.0 was released in
2013.

R enjoys a high popularity in academia and has a large community which both
develops the language and releases new extensions. As a result, [CRAN][1]
emerged as a rich archive of packages extending the base functionality of R.

In case you are interested in more information on the history and features of R,
take a look at the [R project website][2] from which this short summary
originates.
