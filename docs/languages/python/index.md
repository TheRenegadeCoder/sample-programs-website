Welcome to the Python page! Here, you'll find a description of the language as well as a list of sample programs in that language.

## Description

In order to learn more about Python, I took to [Wikipedia][1] for some background.

According to Wikipedia, Python is an interpreted general-purposed language that was created by Guido van Rossum, 
a Dutch programmer, in 1991. Apparently, Python was inspired by ABC, an imperative general-purpose language.

Since 1991, Python has had two major upgrades: Python 2.0 and Python 3.0. In October 2000, Python 2.0 was released. 
Over eight years later, Python 3.0 was released. Currently, the community supports both versions of Python. 
But, Python 2 is slowly losing support.
