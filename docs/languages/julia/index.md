Welcome to the Julia page! Here, you'll find a description of the language as well as a list of sample programs in that language.

## Description

Despite being a relatively new language, Julia has a Wikipedia page. 
As a result, I won't have to dig too much to learn about the language.

At any rate, Julia is a computational science language which fills a 
niche similar to Python and R. In fact, like Python, Julia can be 
used for general-purpose programming.

One of Julia's interesting features is multiple dispatch, something that 
is lacking in Python. Roughly speaking, multiple dispatch allows a user 
to define multiple functions with the same name but different combinations 
of arguments.

In addition, Julia is capable of calling C and Python functions directly. 
Personally, I think that's a fun little feature considering Julia is 
compiled at runtime. So, it gets C-like performance as well, perfect for 
numerical analysis.

Finally, Julia has metaprogramming features, so the language can be 
modified as needed by the user. If Julia ever takes off, we can probably 
expect several different dialects of it to emerge.
