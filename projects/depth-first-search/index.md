In this article, we lay out all the requirements for a depth first search program.

## Description

Depth first search is a type of graph search algorithm. It is often used on trees 
(which are special types of graphs).
It takes linear time to traverse a graph and find a given vertex, specifically O(num_vertices + num_edges).
This search algorithm is often used by web crawlers or in machine learning tasks.
There, the graph that should be traversed is often too big to be do it in a single run.
In such cases, the algorithm can be limited in different ways, for example by limiting depth or visited nodes.

The algorithm traverses the graph one node after the other, but takes priority in going deeper into 
the graph opposed to going broader first. This means, that it visits further children of children before visiting
potential siblings of them.

## Requirements

For the purposes of this project, we'll assume that the search space is a tree represented 
as an adjacency matrix together with a list of the vertex values in the tree.
Specifically, we'll accept three inputs on the command line: the tree adjacency matrix, the list of vertex
values (as integers) and the vertex value to find:

```console
./depth-first-search.lang "0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0" "2, 3, 6, 77, 44, 46, 1, 321, 5" "5"
```

Here we've chosen to represent the graph as a serialized list of integers. Since
the input string represents a square matrix, we should be able to take the
square root of the length to determine where the rows are in the string. In this
case, we have 81 values, so we must have 9 nodes.
If we reformat the input string as a matrix, we'll notice that the values in the
matrix represent the edges between vertices. Taking the vertex values into account as well, the resulting matrix
could look something like the following:

| Mapping | 2   | 3   | 6   | 77  | 44  | 46  | 1   | 321 | 5   |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2       | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 3       | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 6       | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 77      | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 44      | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 46      | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1       | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 321     | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 5       | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

This matrix will result in a tree that looks like this:
```console
            2
         /  |   \
       3    6    77
    /  |   / \     \
  44  46  1  321    5
```

If successful, the script should return `true`. Otherwise, the script should return `false`. 
If any user input errors occur, the script should output the following usage message:
`Usage: please provide a tree in a nested list structure ("[1, [4, 5], 11, [12, [13, 65, [77]]]]") 
and the integer to find ("11")`.
