In this article, we'll write a program that checks if a number is a palindrome or not in Kotlin.

## How to Implement the Solution

code for palindrome.kt:
```kotlin
    fun main() {
    var n: Long
    var num: Long
    var digit: Long
    var rev: Long = 0

    print("Enter a positive number: ")
    num = readLine()!!.toLong()

    n = num

    do {
        digit = num % 10
        rev = (rev * 10) + digit
        num = num / 10
    }while (num != 0L)

    println("The reverse of the number is: $rev")

    if (n == rev){
        println("The number is a palindrome")
    }else{
        println("The number is not a palindrome")
    }
}

```

## How to Run Solution

To run the solution to check if a number is a palindrome or not, we first create some variables we will use in the algorithm in the main function as shown here:
```kotlin
    var n: Long
    var num: Long
    var digit: Long
    var rev: Long = 0
 ```
 Then we will prompt the user to input the number that needs to be checked:
 ```kotlin
    print("Enter a positive number: ")
    num = readLine()!!.toLong()
 ```
 Then we use a do while loop to reverse the number that was typed in:
 ```kotlin
    do {
        digit = num % 10
        rev = (rev * 10) + digit
        num = num / 10
    }while (num != 0L)
```
After the reversal, we show the user the reversal of the number they typed in:
```kotlin
println("The reverse of the number is: $rev")
```
Finally, we check if the number and its reverse are the same or not. If they are the same, we tell the user that the number is a palindrome, otherwise we tell the user the number is not a palindrome as shown here:
```kotlin
    if (n == rev){
        println("The number is a palindrome")
    }else{
        println("The number is not a palindrome")
    }
```
