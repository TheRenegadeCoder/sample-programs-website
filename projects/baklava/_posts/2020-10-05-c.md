In this article, we will look into implementing Baklava using C. 
If you have not looked at C code before, [Hello World in C][1] is a very good place to start.

## How to Implement the Solution
The rules of the problem are simple, print out a diamond shape in simple characters, like below:

               *
              ***
             *****
            *******
           *********
          ***********
         *************
        ***************
       *****************
      *******************
     *********************
      *******************
       *****************
        ***************
         *************
          ***********
           *********
            *******
             *****
              ***
               *

1.  The shape should be symmetrical both horizontally and vertically
2.  Each subsequent line should either add or remove padding by one character on both sides
3.  Whitespace should be adjusted accordingly in order to properly output the shape

The code can be written as follows:
```c
#include "stdio.h"

int main (void)
{

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  {
    printf ("%.*s", (10 - i), "                                 ");
    printf ("%.*s", (i * 2 + 1), "******************************");
    printf ("\n");
  }

  for (int i = 10; -1 < i; i--)
  {
    printf ("%.*s", (10 - i), "                                 ");
    printf ("%.*s", (i * 2 + 1), "******************************");
    printf ("\n");
  }

  return 0;

}
```

### Setup
The first few lines are normal requirements for a simple text program like this.

`#include "stdio.h"` is used to include the standard input/output library, allowing us to use some built in output commands like printf.

After that, `int main(void)` creates the main function, meaning that the code inside the curly braces will be run when the program starts.

### First loop
The expanding top part of the diamond is drawn by the first for loop, starting here:
```c
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
```
This contains 3 separate code statements, and makes up the most basic kind of loop in c.
1. `int i = 0;` Creates a numerical variable `i`, and gives it a value of 0.
2. `i < 10;` Repeatably checks if `i` is less than 10, and continues the loop if it is.
3. `i++` Adds 1 to the value of `i` whenever the loop ends.

Every time the loop runs, all the code inside the curly braces is activated.
Each line is a call to `printf()`, a function used to show text to the user.
1. `printf ("%.*s", (10 - i), "                                 ");`
	This line of code prints out a list of `10 - i` spaces. Here `"%.*s"` is a special sequence used to determine the format. If it was just `%s`, printf would output normal text, but putting `.*` in the middle means that its length can be changed.
2. `printf ("%.*s", (i * 2 + 1), "******************************");`
	This is a similar piece of code, printing `2i + 1` stars to the screen. `i` starts at 0, so the first line will just be one star, but as `i` increases, 2 more stars will be added to each line.
3. `printf("\n");`
	This line is much more simple, and is used like an enter key, moving the text to a new line at the end of each loop.

In the end, this loop of code will produce a large pyramid like this:

               *
              ***
             *****
            *******
           *********
          ***********
         *************
        ***************
       *****************
      *******************

### Second loop
The second for loop is almost identical, and creates the same pyramid as before, but upside down.
```c
for (int i = 10; -1 < i; i--)
```
1. `int i = 10;` Sets `i` to 10 at the start instead of 0.
2. `-1 < i;` The loop runs until `i` is equal to 0.
3. `i--` Here `i` is getting smaller each loop, rather than getting bigger.

Nothing else is changed in the loop, so the final output of the program becomes the full diamond like above.

The line `return 0;` at the end just announces that the program has finished successfully.

## How to Run the Solution
For small programs like this, it is easy to compile and run the code using a website such as [OnlineGDB][2] or [Repl][3].

If we want to run it on a specific computer, we need to install a compiler such as GCC, and type the following commands in a terminal.
```console
c -o baklava baklava.c
./baklava
```
