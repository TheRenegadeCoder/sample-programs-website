In this article, we'll demonstrate how to find Transpose of a Matrix, its requirements, and how
to test it.

## Description

In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; 
that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix A by producing another matrix, often 
denoted by Aáµ€. The transpose of a matrix was introduced in 1858 by the British mathematician Arthur Cayley.

The solution can be generated using nested loops and exchanging the indexes of the matrix.

## Requirements

Input:

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| - |:-:| -:|
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |

The following is the expected output:

| 1 | 4 | 7 |
| - |:-:| -:|
| 2 | 5 | 8 |
| 3 | 6 | 9 |

1.  The first matrix is from the given input.
2.  The second  matrix is the desired output i.e, the transpose of the matrix.

To execute the program:

```
transpose.lang 3 3 "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"
```

Here the first two input numbers indicate the size of the matrix and the next input is the list of numbers to be included in the matrix.

## Testing

Verify that the actual output matches the expected output (see [requirements][1])
