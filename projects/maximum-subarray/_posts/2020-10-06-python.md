In this article, we will be writing a program to calculate the maximum possible sum of a sub array from a given array in Python. We will be using Kadane's Algorithm to find this maximum sum value.

## How to Implement the Solution

Let's look at the code in detail:

code for [maximum_subarray.py](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/master/archive/p/python/maximum_subarray.py):-

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
def maximum_subarray():
   # takes care of both empty input and no input
    str_input = (','.join(i for i in sys.argv[1:])).strip()
    if str_input == "":
        print("Usage: Please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format: '1, 2, 3, 4, 5'")
        return

    # split comma separated input string into list of integers
    arr = [int(num) for num in str_input.split(',')]
    ans = 0
    curr_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if (curr_sum + arr[i] > 0):
            curr_sum += arr[i]
        else:
            curr_sum = 0
        ans = max(ans, curr_sum)
    print(ans)
    return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    maximum_subarray()  # call function to carry out kadane's algorithm
```

### The main Function

Let us breakdown the code in smaller parts,

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    maximum_subarray()
```

This bit of code checks to see if this is the main module run. If true, then it calls the `maximum_subarray()` function which carries out the kadane's algorithm which includes taking array input from standard input(via sys args through the terminal) and computing max subarray sum value and printing the result to standard output.

```python
def maximum_subarray():
    # takes care of both empty input and no input
    str_input = (','.join(i for i in sys.argv[1:])).strip()
    if str_input == "":
        print("Usage: Please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format: '1, 2, 3, 4, 5'")
        return

    # split comma separated input string into list of integers
    arr = [int(num) for num in str_input.split(',')]
    ans = 0
    curr_sum = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if (curr_sum + arr[i] > 0):
            curr_sum += arr[i]
        else:
            curr_sum = 0
        ans = max(ans, curr_sum)
    print(ans)
    return
```

This is the main function of this file which implements all the algorithm logic. It takes a comma separated string of integers from the standard input (via the sys args). It then converts the string into an array of integers and carries out Kadane's algorithm for that array and prints the result. It also deals with the edge case which arises when there is no input or the input string is empty(blank string).

If the string is not empty, the function initialises `ans` (final value to be returned from the function) and `curr_sum` as 0. It then iterates through the array, keeps adding values to `curr_sum` until `curr_sum > 0`. If `curr_sum` goes to less than 0, then `curr_sum` is set to 0 again and process is carried on for the remaining elements of the array.
Finally, `ans` is set to the maximum of `0` and `curr_sum`, and it's value is printed.

1. For example, if `` is the input:

- First we compare, if str_input == ""
- True
- print "Usage: Please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format: '1, 2, 3, 4, 5'"
- return

2. For example, if `-1, -2, 1, 2, 3` is the input:

- First we compare, if str_input == ""
- False
- Convert str_input into array of integers
- Initialise `curr_sum` and `ans` to 0.
- Now while iterating through the array, index `i` goes from 0 to 4.
- For i = 0 and 1, the initial value of `curr_sum` is 0. 0 + (-1) < 0 and 0 + (-2) < 0, so -1 and -2 are skipped.
- For i = 2,3,4 the values 1,2,3 are added to curr_sum iteratively and finally curr_sum value is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
- Max of 0 and 6 is 6. So `ans` gets the value 6.
- Print 6 and return from function.

## How to Run Solution

If you want to run this program, you can download a copy of [Maximum Subarray in Python](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/master/archive/p/python/maximum_subarray.py).

Next, make sure you have the latest Python interpreter (latest stable version of Python 3 will do).

Finally, open a terminal in the directory of the downloaded file and run the following command:

`python maximum_subarray.py 1,2,3,4`

Replace `1,2,3,4` with input of your choice(comma separated integers)

Alternatively, copy the solution into an online [Python interpreter](https://colab.research.google.com) and hit run.
