Removing extra white spaces from a given string

Given a string, remove all spaces from the string and return it with it's _length_.

```c
Input:  " Removing   Extra White   Spaces  "
Output: "removingExtraWhiteSpaces"
```

## Requirements

A string is nothing but an array of characters. The value of a string is determined by the terminating character. Its value is considered to be 0.

As given in the example above, you need to enter a string first up.

The string entered here is as follows: " Removing   Extra White   Spaces  "

As you can see, there are quite a few blank spaces in the string entered above.

Hence, the string becomes like this after removing all the blank spaces:

"removingExtraWhiteSpaces"
