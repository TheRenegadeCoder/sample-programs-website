Welcome to Hello World in Emojicode, a modern language that was created because why not.

## How to Implement the Solution

Let’s take a look at the Hello World sample:

```emojicode
🏁 🍇
  😀 🔤Howdy, World!🔤
🍉
```

I hope that you recognize the phrase `Howdy, World!` in the code. From there we will break down the rest. 

First `🏁` is symbolic of the starting flag in a race and it represents that following it there will be a code block. Also when running it will run the code block that follows the Flag emoji.

Next, code blocks are denoted by starting with a `🍇`, followed by the code, and ending with a `🍉`.

One of the most important emojis is `😀` and this smiling emoji is passed a string and it outputs the string to standard output(in this case the string is `Howdy, World!`).

Finally, the `🔤` emoji is used similarly to "s or 's in other languages as it holds a string within a pair of them.

## How to Run the Solution

There is no better spot to learn how to run the Hello World program in Emojicode than directly from [Emojicode Official Docs][1]
