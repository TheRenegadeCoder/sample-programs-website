In this article, we tackle Hello World in Tex.

## How to Implement the Solution

At any rate, letâ€™s dive right into Hello World in Tex:

```tex
%&pdftex

Hello, World!
\end
```
It is much simpler in Tex due to the fact the Tex is a markup language.

```tex
%&pdftex
```
This first line is a declaring line used to explain that the desired output of this tex file is a pdf.

```tex
Hello, World!
```
This is the body better known as what will be displayed. You could replace that text with anything to have it show up.

```tex
\end
```
Finally, this is saying the document has ended by declaring(`\`) an `end`.

## How to run the Solution
There are many options for running Tex files both online and offline. This said my personal favorite option is running it online through [Overleaf][1]. They even cover the other options including themselves on their website [here][2].
