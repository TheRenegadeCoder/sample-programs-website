In this article, we are going to learn how to implement 'Hello World' in REXX (Restructured Extended Executor), which is an interpreted programming language developed by IBM (Mike Cowlishaw) for the ease of learning and reading.

## How to Implement the Solution

To print 'Hello World!' in Rexx, we need to take note of two points:

- the program starts with a comment line to identify it as a REXX program. Hence, comments are added between /* */.
- use SAY command before the desired output or value

So, let's get to the point and see how to implement the solution:

```REXX
/* Print 'Hello-World!' sample program in REXX */
SAY 'Hello World!'
```

And that's it! It is a very simple one-liner program with a few specifications. The comments tell us what the program does and the intruction 'say' is used to print the program 'Hello World!'.

'SAY' is a basic command to print output on the same lines as 'PRINT' from Python. It remains constant regardless of the version.

## How to Run the Solution

In order to run this program, you can install REXX through [online sources](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rexx/rexx_installation.htm) and run it. Alternatively, you can directly run it on [online interpreters](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_rexx_online.php).
