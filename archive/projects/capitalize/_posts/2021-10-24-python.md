In this article, we will see how to implement Capitalize program using Python.

## How to Implement Solution
Let's take a look on code for capitalize.py:
```python
import sys

def capitalize(input):
    if len(input) > 0:
        print(input[0].capitalize() + input[1:])


if __name__ == '__main__':
    if(len(sys.argv) == 1 or len(sys.argv[1]) == 0):
        print('Usage: please provide a string')
    else:
        capitalize(sys.argv[1])

```

Now, we will consider this code block by block on the order of execution.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    if(len(sys.argv) == 1 or len(sys.argv[1]) == 0):
        print('Usage: please provide a string')
    else:
        capitalize(sys.argv[1])
```
This code checks if the main module is run. If it is, it then checks if the length of argument string provided by the user is 1 or empty string. If it is, it then prints correct usage pattern. Otherwise, it passes control to capitalize function passing argument string provided by the user.

```python
def capitalize(input):
    if len(input) > 0:
        print(input[0].capitalize() + input[1:])
```
If the length provided by the user string is greater than 0, then it prints first letter of the string capitalized and concatenates the rest of the string.

## How to Run Solution
If we want to run this program, we should probably download a copy of
Capitalize in Python. After that, we should make sure we have the
[latest Python interpreter][1]. From there, we can simply run the following
command in the terminal:

```console
python capitalize.py
```

Alternatively, we can copy the solution into an [online Python interpreter][2]
and hit run.
