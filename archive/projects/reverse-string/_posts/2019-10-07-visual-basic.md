In this article, we're tackling Reverse a String in Visual Basic!

## How to Implement the Solution

Let’s start by looking at the complete algorithm to reverse a string in Visual Basic:

```vb
Module ReverseString
    Public Sub Main(args() As String)
        Dim input = String.Empty
        If args IsNot Nothing Then
            input = String.Join(" ", args)
        End If
        System.Console.WriteLine(ReverseString(input))
    End Sub

    Public Function ReverseString(ByVal input As String) As String
        Dim chars() As Char = input.ToCharArray()
        Array.Reverse(chars)
        Return New String(chars)
    End Function
End Module
```

As we can see, VB.NET is a structured language. In other words, there’s a very 
strong focus on code blocks and control flow structures.

Our first code block is the module declaration. In this case, we’ve declared a 
public module called `ReverseString`. If other libraries needed access to this module, 
they could simply import it by name.

### The `main()` Function

Next, we have our typical main function declaration. Of course, in VB.NET, we 
call them subroutines rather than functions—as indicated by the Sub keyword.

The first thing we do in our `main` function is create a variable named `input` to store the value to be reversed.

```vb
Dim input = String.Empty
```

We then need to populate the `input` variable from the value entered at the command prompt. We can use an array of command line arguments using `args()` as the paramater in `Main()`
As input with spaces will be treated as multiple arguments in the `args()` array we need to build them into the single string `input`.

```vb
Public Sub Main(args() As String)
    If args IsNot Nothing Then
        input = String.Join(" ", args)
    End If
````

We first check that there are arguments to join, and if there are join them with the `String.Join()` function, which takes an array of `args` and joins them together with a space `" "` between them, thereby recreating what was entered at the command line.

Finally, we output to the console with the `System.Console.Writeline` function. 

```vb
System.Console.WriteLine(ReverseString(input))
```

Here we call the `ReverseString()` function with `input` as our argument. We will see below how `ReverseString()` operates and returns to us the reversed string. The reversed string is then passed into the `WriteLine` function and it is output to the console.

### The `ReverseString()` function

Let's take a look at how this function reverses a string.

```vb
Public Function ReverseString(ByVal input As String) As String
    Dim chars() As Char = input.ToCharArray()
    Array.Reverse(chars)
    Return New String(chars)
End Function
```

We take in the value to be reversed into a local variable named `input`.
In order to reverse it we need to convert the string variable `input` into a character array named `chars()`.

```vb
'i.e. ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ',', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!'] 
Dim chars() As Char = input.ToCharArray()
```

The character array `chars` can be reversed using the the `Array.Reverse()` function

```vb
'i.e. ['I', 'd', 'l', 'r', 'o', ',W, ' ', ',', 'o', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'H']
Array.Reverse(chars)
```

Finally, the character array `chars` is coverted/combined into a string and returned.

```vb
Return New String(chars)
```

This function executes correctly with any ASCII string. I also executes with an empty string as input.

## How to Run the Solution

With our solution implemented, we should probably give it a run. Perhaps the easiest
way to run the solution is to copy it into an online VB.NET compiler.

Alternatively, we can run the solution using Microsoft’s very own Visual Studio.
Of course, I’m not sure of it’s support on platforms beyond Windows. Don’t forget
to grab a copy of the Hello World in Visual Basic .NET solution.
