According to [MoonScript.org][1], MoonScript is a dynamic scripting language that
compiles into Lua. What is Lua? Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight,
embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented
programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.

Back to MoonScript, it gives you the full power of Lua while providing a clean
easy syntax without the keyword noise typically seen in a Lua script. MoonScript
can either be compiled into Lua, or it can be dynamically compiled and run using
the moonloader.

How did MoonScript start you may ask? Well, its author [Leaf Corcoran][2] built
MoonScript, started building games with MoonScript, added them to [itch.io][3]—an
online platform for indie games which is also built with MoonScript—then
generalized the code base to a general purpose web framework with both
MoonScript and Lua APIs called Lapis.
