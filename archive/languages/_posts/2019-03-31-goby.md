[According to the GitHub project][1], Goby, formerly known as Rooby, is a 
Ruby-like language written in Go. The goal of the language is to 
provide a small environment for building microservices and API servers. 

Beyond that, the project didn't have much to offer in terms of
use cases or samples. That said, [the official website][2] does give a few
examples of language features including:

- Concurrency Support
- Builtin Multi-threaded Server
- Plugin System

For anyone who would like to give the language a try, Goby can be installed
and ran in REPL mode with the following commands:

```shell
brew tap goby-lang/goby
brew install goby
goby -i
```

Alternatively, you can try running all the sample code snippets using
[the samplerunner script][3] included in the repo:

```shell
./samplerunner.sh run -l goby
```

Feel free to browse some of the articles in the following section to see
the language in action.
