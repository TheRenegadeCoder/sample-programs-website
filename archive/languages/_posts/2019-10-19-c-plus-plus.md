According to [Wikipedia][2], C++ is a general-purpose programming language developed back in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup. Back then, C++ was called “C with Classes.” As you can probably imagine, the name was changed to C++ which is a play on the increment operator.

C++ is probably the most powerful language in existence as it supports both imperative and object-oriented programming features. In addition, it allows you to get extremely close to hardware, so it’s not uncommon to see C++ used in embedded environments and game development.

However, with great power comes great responsibility. As a result, I personally find C++ to be an extremely rough language to use. Unlike Python, which was designed with the “one-way-only” paradigm, C++ allows you to code up a solution in literally any way you want. This can lead to some truly unreadable and complex code.
